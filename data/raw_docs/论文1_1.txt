The agriculture sector in Jordan is among the most
competitive industries, contributing 6% to the country’s
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [1]. However, when
factoring in the indirect contributions of the food sector,
agriculture’s share of GDP can rise to between 25% and
30%. In addition, the agriculture and food industries
together provide employment for roughly 20% to 25% of
the nation’s active workforce [2]. The agriculture sector
plays an important socio-economic role, especially in rural
areas, where it serves as a primary livelihood for local
communities. Jordan’s diverse climatic and geographic
zones give the country a unique competitive edge in
producing and exporting fresh fruits and vegetables.
However, water scarcity poses a critical challenge to its
food system. Classified among the most water-deprived
nations in the world, Jordan’s annual renewable water
resources amount to just 100 cubic meters per person [3].
The agriculture sector is responsible for roughly half of
the country’s water consumption, which has been
particularly hard hit by limited water availability. Securing
adequate freshwater resources-both surface and
groundwater-remains one of the sector’s most pressing
concerns. Beyond water scarcity, the agriculture sector in
Jordan faces several interconnected challenges. These are
the rapid depletion of highland aquifers due to overuse,
inefficient and wasteful irrigation practices, soil
degradation, climate change impacts, advancing
desertification, loss of fertile topsoil, saltwater intrusion
into freshwater reserves, rising crop water requirements,
and the gradual exhaustion of water sources for irrigation
[4]. Jordan’s cultivated land covers approximately 221,000
hectares, of which about 141,000 hectares are rain-fed.
These are primarily planted with olives, cereals (wheat
and barley), and fruit trees (citrus, grapes, bananas, date
palms, stone fruits, pomegranates, figs, apples, and
strawberries). The remaining 80,000 hectares are
irrigated, mainly producing vegetables (tomato, potato,
cucumber, beans, onion, eggplant, squash, and leafy
greens) and fruit trees [5]. In the livestock sector, the total
number of sheep, goats, and cows amounted to 3,000,000,
765,000, and 78,000, respectively [5]. The scarcity of
cultivable land has led to low domestic agricultural output
and a heavy reliance on imported food, posing a major
challenge to Jordan’s agricultural sector. Jordan was able
to achieve varying levels of self-sufficiency across different
commodities. For instance, self-sufficiency stands at 26%
for red meat, 80% for poultry, 100% for cow’s milk, 89%
for fruits including olives, 133% for vegetables, and 100%
for table eggs [4]. Jordan’s agricultural sector is
characterized by a large proportion of small-scale farms,
which are a vital component of the country’s agriculture
and play a significant role in sustaining rural livelihoods.
In 2017, the total number of agricultural holdings was
approximately 107,700, of which over 88% covered less
than 3 hectares. For more than 16% of farming households
in Jordan, agriculture remains the primary source of
income [5]. To a remarkable degree, in Jordan, the
situation of small-scale farmers is shaped by farm size,
production systems, land tenure, and crop types. Key
challenges include limited capacity to adopt modern
practices, high indebtedness, land fragmentation,
restricted market access, and declining export
opportunities due to regional political instability. The
scarcity of responsive extension and rural advisory
services, coupled with the absence of reliable market
information systems, weakens farmers’ bargaining power
and market participation. These constraints heighten
vulnerability to external shocks, reduce productivity, and
limit profitability. Small-scale farmers largely operate at
the bottom of the value chain, capturing minimal value
due to information asymmetry, weak collective action, and
poor market integration. Limited assets and low
productivity further restrict their access to finance, as
their activities are often deemed high-risk and difficult to
monitor [6]. The agriculture sector in Jordan operates
under a loan-pricing system that adjusts based on the risk
associated with specific crops, locations, and financial
products. In some situations, this results in more favorable
terms for certain farmer groups, crop types, or regions. In
others, it leads to steeper borrowing costs due to
heightened risks of default or loss. Farmers across the
country contend with multiple structural and operational
hurdles. These include restricted market access for their
agricultural produce, insufficient tools and mechanisms to
manage production and price risks, and limited access to
financing and essential inputs. These constraints impact
the stability of domestic food supplies and contribute to
persistent challenges around rural income generation and
poverty reduction. Availability of credit and broader
financial services is essential for enabling farm-level
investments that drive productivity, generate employment,
support rural livelihoods, and ensure smoother income
flows. These outcomes, in turn, enhance market
engagement and risk mitigation [7]. Financial access is
also a crucial enabler of agricultural adaptation to climate
change, strengthening the sector’s ability to withstand
environmental shocks and thereby securing long-term food
availability [8]. Despite its importance, access to diverse
and appropriate financial products remains a major
obstacle for small-scale farmers who make up the bulk of
Jordan’s farming population. It is crucial to understand the
various profiles of small-scale families and the conditions
and market context in which they operate. Small-scale
farmers are mostly affected by the availability and quality
of financial services that are key to increasing farm
productivity, profitability, and income [9]. Small-scale
farmers require services that equip them with information,
knowledge, and skills that enable them to cope with
diverse production and marketing challenges. This entails
a wide range of financial services that facilitate business
and market orientation, addressing aspects such as
improving farm business management, postharvest
handling, linking to input and output markets, and
providing digital solutions to access information and
alternative markets. The government of Jordan, through
the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC), has made an
effective contribution to agricultural development and
food security. It does so by providing the necessary funds
Government-Backed Loans Program in Supporting Small-Scale Farmers

and loans for crop cultivation and livestock breeding.
Agricultural lending is indeed a critical mechanism for
raising agricultural growth rates [7]. Loans play a crucial
role in enabling farmers to increase the assets available
for use in production. These assets can then be invested in
infrastructure and the implementation of productive
projects within the sector. This, in turn, would increase
the production performance of small agricultural
enterprises. It also strengthens their ability to manage
debt, which is necessary to deal with downsizing seasons
and other challenges confronting the agriculture sector.
To this end, this paper focuses on the impacts of
agricultural loans that enhance farmers' financial capacity.
More specifically, it focuses on how small-scale farmers
use these loans to purchase productive inputs and achieve
optimal agricultural production. These loans are crucial,
especially in rural communities that depend on agriculture
as their main source of income. To date, there has been
limited scholarly investigation into the experiences of
small-scale farmers who operate independently of formal
value chains and have minimal engagement in commercial
agricultural activities. Little is known about their access to
any financial services or the specific products and services
they demand in Jordan. A report by Palladium Europe BV
highlighted that small-scale farmers in Jordan with viable
business cases face significant challenges in obtaining
financial services, citing high collateral requirements and
interest rates [10]. Another study emphasized the
importance of agricultural loans in Jordan but noted
disparities in loan distribution, with small landowners
favoring medium-term loans [11]. These findings suggest a
gap in research specifically addressing the financial
access and product needs of less commercially oriented
small-scale farmers in Jordan. In general, there is a lack of
comprehensive insight into the range of financial options
available to small-scale farmers in Jordan. Additionally,
how credit constraints hinder agricultural progress and
threaten national food security. Additionally, little is
known about financial practices beyond the realm of
commercial farming and the tight value chain segment. In
response, the research objectives of this study aim to: 1)
investigate the agricultural loan system in Jordan,
including its operations, lending methodologies, and the
types of farmers it serves; 2) explore the financial needs
and demands of small-scale farmers, including value chain
financing requirements; and 3) discuss the impact of
government-backed loans and identify best practices for
supporting small-scale farmers through agricultural
lending programs.
