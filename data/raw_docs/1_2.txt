Jordan's agricultural sector is confronted with significant obstacles that jeopardize its long-term viability and the nation’s food security. These difficulties arise from a mix of limited water availability, harsh climatic conditions, and political instability in the region. They are further compounded by economic factors such as unemployment, rising food prices, and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has further strained food systems, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities in the sector. A critical issue facing agriculture in Jordan is the fragmentation of farmland, where many rural households own multiple, non-contiguous plots scattered across different areas. This pattern highlights inefficiencies in land governance, underdeveloped land tenure frameworks, and weak spatial planning. As a result, farmers struggle to scale their operations effectively, which limits profitability and contributes to environmental harm, including soil degradation and erosion [25]. Despite government interventions such as water-use subsidies, import tariffs, and export levies, the cost of agricultural operations has continued to rise. Although labor expenses have declined due to an influx of lower-cost foreign workers, investments in human capital deliver a lower economic return than capital investments. Nonetheless, many farmers still opt for inexpensive labor, as the costs of essential agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and agrochemicals remain high. A further constraint is the lack of access to advanced, efficient farming technologies, which prevents farmers from modernizing their operations or benefiting from economies of scale. The dominance of middlemen in the supply chain also diminishes farmers' earnings, as they receive minimal returns on their produce in both domestic and export markets. Financial institutions and credit mechanisms often do not adequately serve this group, hindering agricultural expansion. Farmers cooperatives, in particular, face difficulties in absorbing financial pressures and are often unable to coordinate effectively, which weakens the sector’s capacity to scale up operations in priority areas [25]. Climate change further complicates these challenges, with declining rainfall, rising drought frequency, and worsening land degradation. These effects severely impact productivity, especially for farmers relying on rain-fed crops and livestock grazing. This environmental stress has contributed to reduced agricultural output among small scale producers. Although agriculture accounted for just 5.2% of Jordan’s GDP in 2020 [26] and rose modestly to 6% by 2023, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, its broader economic influence is substantial. Through its extended value chain, the sector contributes roughly 25–30% to the economy. Jordan has achieved self-reliance in several agricultural commodities, such as fruits, vegetables, poultry, olive oil, and eggs. However, it remains dependent on imports of staple goods such as wheat, barley, and red meat [27]. In 2022, Jordan ranked 47th out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Government-Backed Loans Program in Supporting Small-Scale Farmers 5 Index (GFSI), with a score of 66.2 out of 100, reflecting its overall performance across the GFSI’s four key dimensions. These pillars are economic resilience (affordability), production and agricultural resilience (availability), nutritional resilience (quality and safety), and environmental resilience (sustainability and adaptation) [28]. The prevalence of undernourishment was 8.5% and the number of undernourished was 0.9 million out of the total population in Jordan between 2017 and 2019 [29]. However, these numbers are expected to increase due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the negative impact of climate change, and the deterioration of land and water resources. The post COVID-19 period has further weakened the economy, adding to this fragility
