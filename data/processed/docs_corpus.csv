Therefore, it is imperative to investi- gate cancer incidence, mortality rates, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to enhance preventive measures and healthcare resource allocation. This study aimed to assess cancer burden and associated risk factors in 204 coun- tries and territories between 1980 and 2021.

Results In 2021, cancer accounted for 14.57% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.65–15.28) of total deaths and 8.8% (7.99–9.67) of total DALYs in both sexes globally. ASIR and ASDR were 790.33 (694.43–893.01) and 116.49 (107.28–124.69), respec- tively. Additionally, females exhibited higher ASIR than males (923.44 versus 673.09), while males exhibited higher ASDR than females (145.69 versus 93.60). This indicates that policymakers should focus on the importance of gender equality in healthcare. Non-melanoma skin cancer exhibited the highest ASIR (74.10) in both sexes, while digestive cancers accounted for 39.29% of all cancer-related deaths, and Asia exhibited the heaviest cancer burden. In females, breast cancer exhibited the highest ASIR (46.40) and ASDR (14.55). In males, tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer exhibited the highest ASIR (37.85) and ASDR (34.32), highlighting the urgent need for targeted tobacco control measures. Different cancers in various countries exhibit unique characteristics. Therefore, policymakers should formulate specific prevention and control strategies that reflect the cancer in their country. Tobacco was the primary level 2 risk factor for cancer DALYs in males. It accounted for 29.32% (25.32–33.14) of all cancer DALYs. Dietary risks, alcohol consumption, and air pollution accounted for 5.89% (2.01–10.73), 5.48% (4.83–6.11), and 4.30% (2.77–5.95) of male cancer DALYs, respectively. Therefore, policymakers should prioritize smoking regulation and other carcinogenic risks. Conclusion Cancer is a significant public health concern globally. Understanding the common etiologies of different can- cers is essential for developing effective control strategies and targeted interventions.

1,3,"Page 2 of 14 Wu et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2024) 17:119 Introduction Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and the global cancer burden is expected to increase over the next two decades1 . In 2022, there were approximately 20 million new cancer cases, including non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths, including NMSC2 . Efforts must encompass comprehensive assessments of cancer bur - den, including incidence and mortality rates and disa - bility-adjusted life years (DALYs), particularly between developing and developed countries. The aging global population, combined with the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles and environmental changes, has contributed to an increase in cancer incidence, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Cancer epidemiological studies are essential for developing government health policies because they provide crucial data for identify - ing cancer risk factors, management at the population level, formulation of cancer screening policies, and allocation of resources for cancer prevention3,4. Although some cancer cases may be inevitable, gov - ernments can establish policies that can reduce popu - lation-level exposure to recognized cancer risk factors, including smoking, overweight, obesity, and infections. Epidemiological data and variations in cancer types dif - fer across global regions. In 2022, Asia accounted for approximately 50% of all cancer cases (49.2%) and the highest cancer-related deaths (56.1%), while Europe accounted for approximately 25% of global cancer cases (22.4%) and 20.4% of cancer-related deaths2 . In countries with higher human development index (HDI), lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers have the highest incidence among men, while in countries with lower HDI, prostate, lung, and lip and oral cavity can - cers have the highest incidences2 . A previous study reported that prostate cancer is the most common can - cer among men in 40 sub-Saharan African countries. Women have a",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,4,"14.1% risk of developing cancer by the age of 75 in Sub-Saharan Africa, with breast and cervi - cal cancers accounting for 50% of this risk at 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively5 . In 2020, the overall risk of can - cer-related death among women in Africa was similar to the risks observed in women in Northern America and the wealthiest European countries6 . Consequently, comprehensive assessments of cancer burden will pro - vide valuable insights for improving the global cancer quality control management system. After the COVID- 19 pandemic, patients with cancer seem to experience worsened symptoms and an increased risk of death than others7 . Therefore, assessing the trend of cancer incidence and mortality rates after the pandemic is imperative for formulating cancer control strategies.The Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021 (GBD 2021) framework facili - tates a standardized assessment of cancer burden across various locations and timeframes, focusing on cancer incidence, mortality, and DALYs. The GBD study cat - egorizes age into 5-year intervals and considers the long- term impact of specific disorders globally across various countries and regions. GBD 2021 revealed the proportion of cancer burden attributed to modifiable risk factors and the temporal changes in these percentages8. Primary and secondary preventive measures should be implemented to reduce cancer incidence and mortality while enhanc - ing patient survival rates. Compared to GBD 2019, GBD 2021, for the first time, estimated the onset of cancer mortality from 1980, providing more data for analyzing the dynamic changes of cancer. This study utilized data from GBD 2021 to estimate the incidence, mortality, and contribution of risk factors from 1990/1980 to 2021 in 204 countries and territories to inform policy develop - ment and improve cancer prevention initiatives. Materials and methods GBD source This general framework",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,5,"for the GBD 2021 cancer estima - tion included all malignant cancers except for non-mel - anoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), benign and in situ cancer (intestinal, cervical, uterine, and other benign cancers), and myelo - dysplastic, myeloproliferative, and other hemopoietic cancers. According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the different types of cancer are cat - egorized into 34 categories. The cancer incidence data were collected from a single cancer registry, Nordic cancer registries, or a combined database of cancer reg - istries, including cancer incidence in five continents, surveillance, epidemiology, and outcomes. This analysis depends on current epidemiological data and improved standardized methods. The data are accessible through the Global Health Data Exchange query tool (http:// ghdx. healt hdata. org/ gbd- resul ts- tool), categorized by region, gender, country, and risk factors. Additionally, GBD 2021 calculated essential statistics for 23 different age catego - ries ranging from birth to ≥ 95 years, collectively covering males, females, and all genders. Data were collected for 204 countries and territories, categorized into 21 regions and seven super-regions. We selected neoplasm data on incidence, mortality, and associated risk factors from the GBD study tool for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 and 1980 to 2021. We estimated the age- standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of 34 cancer types categorized as level 3 causes in the GBD hierarchy. For GBD 2021, incidence, prevalence, and disability were assessed for all cancers",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,6,"and benign cancer as classified in ICD-10 (C00–D49). Cancer incidence is directly derived from mortality esti - mates using mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). The current GBD cancer mortality and MIR estimates are based on the methodology described in the latest GBD study, with additional information accessible elsewhere; a concise overview is provided below9–11. Estimates The GBD 2021 collaborators modeled incidence and mortality estimates for male and female individu - als across all age groups. The cause-of-death ensemble model was utilized to estimate cause-specific mortality for each combination of sex, age, location, and year. The GBD team developed the DisMod-MR software (version 2.1), a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to perform inci - dence estimations through an analytical cascade pro - cess. Before the modeling, data points and biases were adjusted by (1) disaggregating data that were not pre - viously disaggregated by age and sex distribution and (2) applying a meta-regression—Bayesian, regularized, trimmed model to compare study designs and case defi - nitions directly. Information regarding bias correction and other modifications implemented for each specific disorder is available in the GBD 2021 capstone report12. DALYs, a summary measure of overall health loss, were calculated by adding years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) for each etiology. YLLs were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths associ - ated with specific causes by the remaining life expectancy at the time of death, based on a standard life expectancy. The GBD 2021 database of mortality causes included data from various sources, including vital registration, verbal autopsy, cancer registries, police records, sibling histories, surveillance, and survey or census data col - lected since 1980. Accordingly, we estimated the burden of DALYs attributed to risk factors in 2021. The GBD comparative risk assessment (CRA) framework was employed to assess the exposure of risk",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,7,"factors associ - ated with digestive diseases and their consequent disease burden. The CRA comprised seven primary interrelated methodological components. The effect size was ini - tially estimated by quantifying the relative risk (RR) of the designated health outcome of exposure to the iden - tified risk factor. The population-attributable fraction of YLL and YLDs was calculated for each risk factor by considering the distribution of exposures across different ages, genders, locations, and years and the RR associated with each level of exposure. The sociodemographic index (SDI) was used to demonstrate variations in cancer bur - den attributed to different levels of socioeconomic devel - opment. It was determined by factors including the total fertility rate in women below 25 years, income per capita distribution over time, and average education levels for individuals aged ≥ 15 years13. The index ranged from 0 (low SDI) to 100 (high SDI), classifying countries in 2021 into five groups based on quintiles: low, low-middle, mid - dle, high-middle, and high SDI. Statistical analysis Based on the GBD framework, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all estimates were calculated by averaging the data from 1,000 draws, with the lower and upper bounds of the 95% UIs established by the 25th and 975th ranked values among all 1,000 draws. R software (version 4.2.3) was used for data analysis. This study utilized data from the GBD study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington and is publicly accessible. The GBD study analyses adhered to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Esti - mates Reporting13. Results The burden of cancers in the global In 2021, cancer accounted for 14.57% (95% UI, 13.65– 15.28) of total mortality and 8.8% (7.99–9.67) of total DALYs across both sexes globally. During the same period, the ASIR",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf

Fig - ure 1 depicts the disparities in the incidence rates and proportion of cancer cases between males and females. In 2021, females exhibited a higher ASIR than males (923.44 versus 673.09), while males exhibited a higher ASDR than females (145.69 versus 93.60). In both sexes, non-melanoma skin cancer exhibited the highest ASIR (74.10), followed by tracheal, bronchial, and lung (TBL) cancer (26.43), colon and rectal cancer (25.61), breast cancer (24.56), prostate cancer (15.37), and stomach cancer (14.33). TBL cancer exhibited the highest ASDR (23.50), followed by colon and rectal cancer (12.40), stomach cancer (11.20), breast cancer (7.90), and esopha - geal cancer (6.25). In females, breast cancer exhibited the highest ASIR (46.40) and ASDR (14.55). In males, TBL cancer exhibited the highest ASIR (37.85) and ASDR (34.32). Digestive cancer accounted for 39.29% of all can - cer-related deaths (Figure S1). Age-related sex-specific patterns exhibited some varia - tion. Between 1990 and 2021, females exhibited a higher cancer incidence and ASIR than males, and ASIR dem - onstrated a stable trend. Between 1980 and 2021, males exhibited a higher rate of cancer deaths and ASDR than females, and ASDR demonstrated a decreased trend. The ASDR of cancer decreased by approximately 24.81% in males and 24.47% in females in the past 40 years globally (Fig. 2). In 2021, breast cancer accounted for 5.28% of all cancer incidence and 15.29% of cancer-related deaths in",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf

The ASIR of breast cancer in females was 46.40 (43.26– 49.56), and the ASDR was 14.54 (13.45–15.56). The ASIR of prostate cancer in males was 34.05 (31.27–36.00), and the ASDR was 12.63 (11.16–13.55). From 1990 to 2021, the percentage change in ASIR was 0.04% (0.01–0.07), while the percentage change in ASIR was –0.02% (–0.04, 0) from 2019 to 2021. The percentage change in ASDR decreased from 1990 to 2021 and from 2019 to 2021 (Table S1). In 2021, the incidence rates were highest among women aged 60 to 64 years and men aged 65–69 years. Before the age of 55–59, the incidence rate in females was higher than that in males, while from age 65 to 69, the incidence rate in males was higher than that in females (Fig. 3A). Cancer incidence is increasing among younger individuals, particularly among women under the age of 50. The death rate was highest among individu - als aged 70–74 years for males and females, and before the age of 40–44, the death rate in females was higher than that in males (Fig. 3B). Burden of cancers in countries Across the 21 GBD regions, high-income North Amer - ica exhibited the highest observed ASIR: 3138.73 (2786.29–3519.73), followed by Central Europe: 1308.53 (1147.64–1501.09) and high-income Asia Pacific: 1253.28 (1092.47–1,462.55) (Figure S2). Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited the lowest observed ASIR: 268.54 (238.04–300.85), followed by Western and Central Sub- Saharan Africa. Central Europe exhibited the highest observed ASDR: 157.77 (146.33–167.79), followed by Southern Sub-Saharan Africa: (144.19 (132.84–154.13) and East Asia: 137.08 (115.32–162.11). Furthermore, South Asia exhibited the lowest observed ASDR: 74.73 (68.77–81.23), followed by Western Sub-Saharan Africa: 89.08 (72.14–103.40), and North Africa and the Mid - dle East: 90.11 (80.96–99.52)",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf

From 1990 to 2021, Southern Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited the largest percentage increase in the rates of cancer deaths: 22% (11%–35%), while Australasia exhibited the biggest per - centage decline in the rates of cancer deaths (–30%, –34% to –27%) (Table S1). In 2021, the ASIR exhibited variations globally. Across the 204 countries, the United States of America exhibited the highest ASIR: 3,304.9 (2941.64–3699.14), followed by Canada: 1,758.48 (1470.8–2062.1) and Greenland: 1,751.13 (1468.51–2039.7). Meanwhile, Burundi exhib - ited the lowest observed ASIR: 243.71 (206.6–285.36), followed by Madagascar: 243.88 (207.76–281.58) and Kenya: 251.15 (218.01–287.69) (Figs. 4A and S4). Mongo - lia exhibited the highest observed ASDR: 214.81 (188.01, 243.86), followed by Monaco: 207.69 (173.54–245.45) and Zimbabwe: 201.33 (162.95–246.3). Furthermore, Oman Fig. 1 Differences in incidence rate and proportion of cancer cases among males and females",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf

Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2024) 17:119 exhibited the lowest observed ASDR: 44.21 (36.51– 52.81), followed by the Maldives: 47.86 (39.57–56.19) and Algeria: 51.51 (43.01–61.21) (Figs. 4B and S5). Between 1990 and 2021, the United States of America exhibited the largest percentage increase in cancer incidence: 88% (78%–97%), while Burundi exhibited the biggest percent - age decline in cancer incidence (–15%, –26% to –1%). Additionally, between 1990 and 2021, Lesotho (80%, 32% to 140%) exhibited the largest percentage increase in cancer-related deaths, while Kazakhstan (–50%, –56% to –44%) exhibited the biggest percentage decline in cancer- related deaths (Table S2). SDI and cancer burden In 2021, the high SDI quintile exhibited the highest ASIR: 1671.46 (95% UI: 1484.99–1875.02) and ASDR 123.22 (95% UI: 113.06–128.96), while the low SDI exhibited the lowest ASIR: 336.09 (95% UI: 288.48–385.96) and ASDR: 90.64 (95% UI: 79.86–102.00). Figure 5 depicts the changes in age-standardized incidence and death rates across five SDIs from 1990/1980 to 2021. The find - ings suggest a significant increase of ASIR and ASDR in high-SDI and high-middle SDI regions. However, low, middle, and low-middle SDIs exhibited a stable trend in ASIR and ASDR. Based on the changes in age-standard - ized death rates by region, the high-income North Pacific exhibited an increase in ASIR among the four regions with the highest SDI. The ASIR increased gradually as the SDI increased until it reached approximately 0.65, after which it increased significantly. However, the United States of America experienced unexpectedly high ASIR based on SDI levels (Figure S6). The ASDR value in the region level decreased as the SDI increased to approxi - mately 0.34. Subsequently, it increased until it reached Fig. 2 Trends in cancer rates and age-standardized changes globally. Up. The rate of cancer incidence",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf

Burden of cancer attributable to risk factors In 2021, 4.06 million (95% UI: 3.46–4.75) global cancer- related deaths were caused by all estimated risk factors, representing 41.07% (35.24–46.64) of all cancer-related deaths for both sexes. Risk factors caused 2.56 million (95% UI: 2.20–2.99) cancer-related deaths in males and 1.50 million (95% UI: 1.16–1.83) in females, account - ing for 45.65% (40.72–50.77) of all male cancer-related deaths and 35.08% (27.38–42.23) of all female cancer- related deaths. The global overall cancer DALYs attrib - uted to estimated risk factors were 100.30 million (95% UI: 86.19–116.72) for both sexes, representing 39.59% (34.18–44.88) of all cancer DALYs. Males accounted for 62.09 million (95% UI: 53.92–72.60) cancer DALYs due to risk factors, representing 43.81% (29.81–46.07) of all cancer DALYs, while females accounted for an estimated 38.21 million (95% UI: 32.8–43.1) cancer DALYs attribut - able to risk factors, representing 34.21% (27.05–40.69) of all cancer DALYs in females. Global geographical pattern variations were observed for cancer age-standardized DALY rates caused by environmental and occupational, behavioral, and metabolic risks across different regions. Higher age-standardized DALY rates were observed in central Europe within these level 1 risk factor categories (Figure S8). Tobacco was the primary level 2 risk factor for cancer DALYs in males, contributing to 29.32% (25.32–33.14) of all cancer DALYs, followed by dietary risks, alcohol use, and air pollution, which accounted for 5.89% (2.01– 10.73), 5.48% (4.83–6.11), and 4.30% (2.77–5.95) of male cancer DALYs in 2021, respectively.

1,17,"sex was the primary level 2 risk factor for females based on cancer DALYs. It comprised 8.88% (8.40–9.49) of all female cancer DALYs, followed by tobacco: 8.09% (6.12– 10.05), dietary risks 7.21% (1.96–12.92), and high BMI 4.72% (1.86–7.59) (Figure S9). Discussion This study provided a comprehensive overview of the global cancer burden and demonstrated significant trends and disparities in cancer incidence and mortal - ity across genders, age groups, and geographical regions. The ASDR for cancer decreased by approximately 24.81% in males and 24.47% in females globally in the past 40 years. In 2021, digestive cancer accounted for 39.29% of all cancer-related deaths; thus, interventions aimed at promoting healthy diets and early screening for early signs of these cancers could potentially alleviate their burden. Significantly, TBL cancer exhibited the highest cancer burden, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted tobacco control measures. We demonstrated the signifi - cant impact of cancer on global health and highlighted the need for targeted interventions to alleviate this burden. Data from 2021 reveal that cancers accounted for a sig - nificant percentage of global total deaths (14.57%) and DALYs (8.8%), indicating their critical role as an essential contributor to the GDB. The observed ASIR of 790.33 per 100,000 individuals and ASDR of 116.49 per 100,000 indi - viduals signify the ubiquitous nature of cancer as a public health issue. Although the ASIR for females exceeded that of males, the ASDR was higher among males, indi - cating an increasing incidence of cancer among women while mortality is disproportionately high among men. This gender disparity illustrates variations in risk factors, including smoking and alcohol consumption, which are more common among men, and gender-specific cancers, including breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Globally, the incidence of female breast cancer is continuously increasing in regions",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,18,"including North America, Australasia, and Africa, indicating the impact of social and economic development on the disease. Fac - tors including age, sex, estrogen levels, family history, an unhealthy lifestyle, and gene mutations can all increase the risk of developing breast cancer14. The 5-year rela - tive survival rates for breast cancer exhibit significant disparity between developed and developing countries. The rates exceed 90% in North America and Japan but fall below 40% in African countries such as Algeria15. Breast cancer is preventable, and developed countries have suffi - cient medical resources, including annual mammography screenings or daily chemopreventative drugs, to miti - gate the risk of the disease. The strategy for breast can - cer prevention involves enhancing primary prevention measures, including the avoidance of alcohol and excess dietary fat consumption, adoption of a healthy lifestyle, timely childbirth, and breastfeeding. Breast and prostate cancer are generally hormone-dependent and exhibit significant biological similarities.

1,19,"Page 12 of 14 Wu et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2024) 17:119 breast cancer in females significantly affects the overall female ASIR and ASDR. This highlights the importance of breast cancer prevention, early detection, and treat - ment strategies in reducing the female cancer burden. Although prostate cancer is not the primary cause of can - cer deaths among males, it significantly affects the male ASDR. Enhanced treatment options and screening strat - egies for prostate cancer may contribute to a decrease in male cancer mortality rates. Since the mid-2000s, the incidence rates of female breast cancer have gradually increased by approximately 0.5% annually, which can be partially attributed to the continuing decline in fertility rates and the increase in excess body weight16. The rap - idly growing population and the significant number of men reaching the age of ≥ 65 contribute to a higher ASIR of prostate cancer17. The incidence rates of prostate cancer are highest in developed countries where there is increased awareness of the disease and widespread use of prostate-specific antigen tests for screening18. Although breast and prostate cancers significantly influence the overall gender disparities in cancer incidence and mor - tality, these disparities cannot be ascribed to these two cancers. Additional research and customized strategies are required to address the broader issue of gender dis - parities in cancer. The variation in the cancer types across regions is affected by the unique environmental characteristics, die - tary habits, and lifestyles specific to each area. Our study revealed that South Asia exhibited the highest incidence and mortality rates for lip and oral cavity cancer. The risk factors include unhealthy lifestyle habits (betel quid consumption), poor oral hygiene, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and limited medical resources19. Enhancing the quality of health education for residents, improving their",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,20,"oral hygiene awareness and living habits, and invest - ing in and constructing medical resources are essential to reducing lip and mouth cancer incidence and mortal - ity rates. Additionally, the highest incidence and mortal - ity rates of liver cancer are predominantly concentrated in the Asia Pacific and sub–Saharan Africa, primarily attributable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Liver cancer in China and West - ern Sub-Saharan Africa is caused mainly by chronic HBV infection, while in South Korea and Japan, HCV infection is the primary causative factor for liver cancer20. Despite the ongoing increase in cancer cases, there has been a significant decline in the ASR of liver cancer in specific regions over the past few decades. The reduction in ASR is primarily attributable to the effective control of HBV infection through vaccination initiatives. Metabolic syn - drome, obesity, and NAFLD are increasing and may col - lectively emerge as the leading cause of liver cancer21. Consequently, it is recommended that different countries re-evaluate their prevention strategies. The ASIR of malignant skin melanoma in New Zealand and Australa - sia exceeded the global average due to the proximity of Oceania to the ozone hole over the Antarctic, leading to increased UV exposure in the region. Meanwhile, the warm climate and favorable conditions for outdoor activ - ities in the equatorial regions allow individuals to wear minimal clothing and experience increased exposure to UV radiation, thereby increasing the risk of skin cancer consistent with this geographical trend22. As a result, enhancing public awareness and attention to malignant melanoma is essential to mitigating its incidence risk. Public health policies must be tailored to specific envi - ronmental factors, dietary habits, and lifestyles in differ - ent regions. TBL cancer was the most common and primary",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,21,"cause of death across all cancer types, particularly in East Asia and Central Europe. The global morbidity and mortal - ity rates of TBL cancer in males were 2.2 times and 2.4 times higher than that in females, respectively, primarily attributed to the higher rate of smoking among males. Greenland and Monaco have the highest ASIR and ASDR observed in TBL. Smoking was identified as the primary risk factor contributing to the incidence of lung cancer in men, although air pollution and occupational exposure play a significant role. Smoking patterns were identified as the primary factor contributing to the incidence of lung cancer in women23. A previous study reported that indoor air pollution from cooking and heating signifi - cantly contributes to lung cancer incidence, particularly in East Asia, where female smokers are uncommon24. Over time, lung cancer rates decreased among male smokers in Europe, while the rates increased among women who smoke25. Hence, initiatives to reduce both smoking prevalence and secondhand smoke exposure are essential. Regular screening with low-dose computed tomography of the chest resulted in a significant decrease in lung cancer mortality among heavy smokers, includ - ing nonsmokers26. A comprehensive strategy for preven - tion is required; this includes enhancing tobacco control measures, reducing air pollution, and promoting healthy diets and lifestyles. Implementing comprehensive smoke- free policies, augmenting public awareness campaigns, and providing smoking cessation services can effectively reduce tobacco consumption and its detrimental health effects 27,28. This study has some limitations. First, due to the exten - sive and complex nature of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the TBL cancer burden. Second, establishing a correlation between the COVID- 19 pandemic and cancer incidence and mortality rates was difficult and thus resulted in erroneous data. Third, GBD estimates were based on covariates and modeling",s13045-024-01640-8.pdf
1,22,"parameters in cases where data were unavailable, poten - tially leading to overestimating or underestimating the cancer burden. Conclusion Cancer is a major global public health concern. The ASDR of cancer has decreased globally between 1980 and 2021. However, breast, tracheal, bronchial, and lung can - cers are the most significant cancer burden globally. Vari - ous regions and countries may have distinct risk factors for specific cancer types. Understanding the common etiologies of various cancers is essential for formulating effective control strategies and targeted interventions consistent with local characteristics and environments.

Alt- hough forecast information has been widely incorporated to address this hedging prob- lem, its effectiveness is heavi ly dependent on forecast accuracy. Integrating abundant his- torical canal scheduling data with forecast information provides a promisi ng pathway to improve scheduling performance, yet relevant studies remain limited. This study intro- duces the concept of Target Residual Lump -Sum Water Quota ( TRLSWQ ) for each time interval and develops a novel “Bi-level, Two -stage” (BT) model for dynamically updated canal-system scheduling that jointly leverages TRLSWQ and forecast information. The model defines clear canal scheduling rules and effectively adapts to the hierarchical struc- ture in canal system scheduling . The model is applied to the summer –autumn irrigation scheduling of the Yongji main canal and six associated sub -canals in the Hetao Irrigation Area, Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicate that compared with",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,2,"the conventional model, the BT model reduces the total water shortage index of sub -canals from 40.81 to 31.44 (a decrease of 22. 9%) and increases the utilization rate of the water quota from 89.3% to 92.9% (an increase of 3.9%). Furthermore, this study clarifies the mechanism of canal scheduling deviations caused by forecast errors: ea rly-stage rainfall under -forecasting in- duces excessive early -stage allocation, leaving no water for later periods, whereas early - stage over -forecasting leads to withheld early allocation and unused residual lump -sum quota in later stages. The BT model effe ctively balances shortage risks between current and future periods and offers a practical and robust strategy for improving dynamic canal scheduling in irrigation districts.

2,3,"1. Introduction Water scarcity is one of the most severe challenges facing the world in the 21st cen- tury. Over 70% of extracted freshwater resources are consumed by global irrigated agri- culture [1], with canal water delivery efficiency in numerous traditional irrigation a reas still falling below 60% [2]. Therefore, improving irrigation water -use efficiency is of great urgency, and its enormous potential in alleviating water resource scarcity remains largely untapped [3,4]. In this context, optimal canal system scheduling t echnology, as a key breakthrough in agricultural water resource management, has attracted extensive atten- tion globally. The canal system scheduling aims to optimize water distribution among multi -level canal systems based on real -time soil moisture conditions, farmers ’ declared use plans, and forecasted inflow at canal heads, thereby generating coordinated operational sched- ules for both main and subsidiary canals. Through the simulation of canal control and crop growth processes, the scheduling objective is to achieve t he optimal spatiotemporal distribution of agricultural water resources and ensure smooth canal operation, w hile meeting crop water requirements and adhering to constraints related to canal safety and ecological conditions [ 5,6]. Proper canal scheduling minimizes deviations between the planned water consumption process and the water allocation process, thereby reducing the risk of water scarcity and conveyance losses. Conversely, an unsuitable canal sched- uling may cause the wate r delivery process to overlap with rainfall events, force primary canals to operate at high load for extended periods during peak -demand stages, or lead to prolonged semi -capacity operation of the canal system [ 7,8]. Such circumstances can lead to crop los ses due to waterlogging, damage to canal system structures, and increased seepage losses during water conveyance. The canal scheduling system is a complex system involving multiple stakeholders, multiple levels, and multiple dimensions,",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,4,"including government bodies, farmers, and ad- ministrators of main, branch, lateral, and field canals. Since Suryavanshi and Reddy [ 9] pioneered the 0–1 programming method to study the optimal grouping of lower -level ca- nals, scholars have conducted extensive research on canal system scheduling optimiza- tion, transitioning from traditional empirical methods to more scientific and precise op ti- mization strategies [ 10]. The development of irrigation canal scheduling can generally be categorized into three phases: the initial experience -based phase relying on managers ’ personal expertise [ 11], the simulation –optimization phase integrating optimization mod- els with canal system hydrodynamic simulation models, and the current intelligent and informatized phase using new technologies such as decision -making based on big data and artificial intelligence. Over the past four decades, the scope of resear ch on canal sched- uling has expanded. It has evolved from solely studying the optimal grouping problem of terminal canal systems under the scenario of “fixed flow rate and variable duration ” [9] to the grouping problem under “variable flow rate and variable duration ” [12]. Subse- quently, it has gradually extended to researching issues such as the schedule of the entire canal system, including how to group terminal canals and how to implement continuous water conveyance in main canals, the coordination between canal scheduling and canal gate control [ 10], and the collaborative optimization between canal system scheduling and water resource allocation in irrigation districts [1 3]. The canal scheduling models have developed from the initial single -agent single -objective or multi -objective optimization models [ 11,14,15] to the present multi -agent, multi -level [6], and multi -objective models [5,16]. The algorithms used to solve these models have progressed from initial mathemat- ical programming algorithms (e.g., the simplex method) to modern intelligent optimiza- tion algorithms such as",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,5,"the simulated annealing algorithm [1 7], genetic algorithm [ 18,19], ant colony algorithm [ 20], backtracking search algorithm [ 21], and particle swarm optimi- zation algorithm [ 22]. Additionally, modern technologies such as machine learning have",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,6,"been applied to canal scheduling [23] . The above -mentioned studies have established a rich foundation for optimizing scheduling in canal systems. Despite these advancements, a primary challenge in current research on optimal ca- nal system scheduling is that the resulting canal schedules often have limited practical applicability in enhancing operational efficiency. These schedules typically involve e x- tended time horizons, such as schedules for annual, irrigation seasons, crop growth stages, or individual irrigation events. These canal schedules are generally static and are developed based on historical canal schedules and fixed crop growth calendars. In the context of increasing hydrological variability due to climate change and rapid shifts in crop planting structures, such static schedules struggle to respond effectively to unfore- seen meteorological events, such as short -term rainfall, heatwaves, or droughts. There- fore, leveraging the latest soil moisture monitoring data and short -term hydrometeoro- logical forecasts to formulate canal operation schedules for single irrigation events in ca- nal systems and update these schedules dynamically in real time t o achieve precise and efficient spatial –temporal allocation of the total irrigation water in canal systems consti- tutes an effective approach to improving the scheduling efficiency of canal systems. How- ever, to the best of the authors ’ knowledge, there are currently very few studies reporting models or algorithms for dynamically updated irrigation canal scheduling [ 10,24]. Alt- hough in practical irrigation district management, rolling canal water distribution plan- ning with a 5 -day cycle has been issued [ 25,26], and a substantial body of research ha s reported methods for formulating rolling or real -time irrigation schedules [ 27–30] as well as reservoir operation schemes [ 31,32]. Under the constraint of a fixed initial lump -sum water quota ( ILSWQ) for the entire crop growth stage, the dynamically updated canal",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,7,"scheduling requires decisions regard- ing the water allocation volume at each canal system ’s intake for the current period. Spe- cifically, it must determine whether to fully meet the water intake demand or only par- tially fulfill it, in order to mitigate the potential risk of greater water shortages in subse- quent periods. Traditional methods for d ynamically updating irrigation pla ns balance wa- ter allocation volumes between the current and future periods by assuming that hydro- meteorological forecasts for the remaining period are entirely accurate. If this assumption holds, such a balancing strategy may be considered optimal. However, this strategy pre- sents two key limitations: first, accurate hydrometeorological forecasts for the crop growth period are inherently difficult to achieve [ 30]; second, relying solely on forecast data while neglecting long -term historical canal scheduling information is inadequate. The risk hedging strategy, as proposed by the two -stage model, offers a novel perspective and valuable insight for addressing these limitations. This approach has been widely ap- plied in both theoretical research and practical app lications in reservoir operation. As early as more than sixty years ago, Maass et al. [ 33] first introduced the risk hedging strat- egy into reservoir operation, aiming to offset the risk of potentially unacceptable severe water shortages in the future throu gh tolerable minor water shortages during a series of current periods. Draper and Lund [ 34], along with You and Cai [ 35], have provided com- prehensive reviews on the evolution of hedging methods in reservoir operations. Zeng et al. [36] extended this approach to parallel reservoir systems, developing a two -stage joint operation model and proposing new joint operation rules with analytical expressions. In canal system scheduling decision-making, the ILSWQ can be regarded as stored in a vir- tual reservoir, and the water",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,8,"allocation process for each canal in each period can be deter- mined by applying similar hedging rules. By incorporating information from historical canal scheduling processes and analyzing the temporal variation in residual lump-sum water quota ( RLSWQ) across different years, the canal scheduling hedging rules can rea- sonably control the timeline of water volume release in the virtual reservoir , avoid artifi- cial water shortages or waste, and help enhance the stability of canal scheduling processes.",agriculture-15-02527.pdf

2,10,"However, to date, there is no reported research on the application of risk hedging princi- ples to the dynamically updated canal scheduling process. This study aims to: (1) explore and propose a dynamically updated canal scheduling framework that reduces current -period water allocation to increase remaining -period al- location, hedging against future water shortage risks; (2) study the balance strategy be- tween current and remaining -period water shortage risks; (3) establish a new dynamically updated canal scheduling model integrating hydrometeorological forecast information and long -term historical canal scheduling data of irrigation districts; and (4) analyze the model performance and the mechanism of canal scheduling deviations caused by forecast errors.

2,11,"that period is determined based on the established rules. After the implementation of the canal schedule for one period is completed, the latest forecast information is updated for the start of the next period, and the canal schedule decision for the next period is contin- ued. This process rolls forward sequentially from one period to the next until the canal schedules for all periods are finalized. The following section provides a detailed introduction to the “Bi-level, Two -stage” dynamically updated canal scheduling model and presents the method for determining its canal scheduling rules. To compare the performance of different canal scheduling strat- egies, this study also introduces the conventional dynamically updated canal sched uling model based on forecast information (abbreviated as the CC model) and the optimal static canal scheduling model (abbreviated as the OC model), which assumes the hydrom eteor- ological forecasts are entirely accurate.

The “Bi-Level, Two-Stage” Dynamically Updated Canal Scheduling Model 2.1.1. Canal Scheduling Rule Optimization Model A single canal scheduling process is divided into two phases in the BT model: the current period and the remaining period (excluding the current period). The optimiza- tions of TRLSWQ and TWV are, respectively , designated as the upper and lower levels of the Bi-level structure for separate optimization. The optimization of TWV involves solving a parametric programming problem with TRLSWQ as the parameter, where the upper - level specifies TRLSWQ . The purpose of adopting the Bi-level optimization in the BT model is to reflect the hierarchical governance of canal system scheduling: the upper -level agent (e.g., the main canal administrator) aims to regulate the use of the RLSWQ over the entire irrigation district and time horizon to maximize system -wide benefit, whereas each lower-level agent (e.g., the sub-canal manage ment agency ) seeks, subject to the TRLSWQ given by the upper -level, to optimize sub -canal scheduling performance within its own control area. The upper -level takes the TRLSWQ as the decision variable and transmits a set of obtained values to the lower -level each time during the optimization process. The lower - level, when the TRLSWQ is given by the upper -level each time, takes the minimum two - stage canal schedule efficiency loss as the objective function, takes the TWV as the decision variable, calculates the corresponding canal schedule process for each period, and feeds it back to the upper -level to derive the value of",agriculture-15-02527.pdf

2,17,"Figure 1. Conceptual diagram of a single water source irrigation canal system. Different from the black -box operation of conventional dynamically updated canal scheduling practice based solely on forecast information, this study assumes that dynam- ically updated canal scheduling determines the water allocation volumes for the main ca- nals and sub -canals illustrated in Figure 1 by integrating the latest hydrometeorological forecast information and historical canal schedule data in accordance with specific canal scheduling rules. The canal scheduling rules include two key water volume par ameters: first, the TRLSWQ that the water source should retain in each period to meet crop water demand; second, the threshold water volume ( TWV) triggering water supply reduction in each current period to mitigate the risk of more severe water shortages in subsequent pe- riods. These two parameters complement and are interrelated with each other: a higher TRLSWQ allows for a lower TWV. Canal scheduling decisions are made in accordance with predefined rules at any given period of any year. The entire decision -making process for the distribution period is carried out in multiple steps.

Water Demand Calculation Model The water demand in this study refers to the water demand process of crops during their growth stage. It is calculated based on the field water balance, and the water demand process of the corresponding canal is obtained by summing up the water demands of var- ious crops. When the input meteorological data are forecast values, the water demand calculated by this model is the forecast value. The evapotranspiration of each crop is equal to the product of the reference crop evapotranspiration, the crop coefficient, and the soil moisture correction coefficient. Among these, the reference crop evapotranspiration is calculated according to the Pen- man-Monteith method [ 37].

2,25,"2.2. Comparison Models 2.2.1. The Conventional Dynamically Updated Canal Scheduling Model In each current period, the CC model makes decisions based on the forecast infor- mation of each period from the current period to the end of the decision -making period. When the current period is the ta-th period, the required water demand forecasting pro- cess (DFs) covers the entire periods from the ta-th period to the T-th period (the last period of the canal scheduling decision -making periods). This process is derived by inputting the meteorological forecast of the corresponding periods into the water dema nd calculation model specified in Section 2.1.2. The decision variables are the canal schedules for each period from the current period to the end of the decision -making period, and the objective function is to minimize the sum of water shortage indices for the sub -canals during the decision-making perio d. During the application process, only the canal schedule for the current period (the ta-th period) , specifically the first period obtained through optimi za- tion, is implemented. After the canal schedule for the current period is completed, the forecast information is updated (the periods from the ( ta + 1)-th period to the T-th period) , and the following decision -making process is initiated. The canal schedule for each sub- sequent period is carried out in accordance with the same procedure until the canal sched- ule for all periods is completed. The mathematical form of the CC model is as follows.

Also, the TRLSWQ and TWV lines all lie within the upper and lower envelope bounds of the actual RLSWQ in 2001~2010.

To analyze the causes of the differences in canal scheduling and further explore the mecha- nism by which the BT model achieves better results in dynamically updated canal sched- uling, this section selects two representative scenarios for analysis: scenarios with under- estimated and overestimated forecast precipitation in earlier periods. 3.3.1.

In terms of the temporal distribution of delivered water, the BT model achieves a more balanced alloca- tion across the irrig ation season. By deliberately constraining early -season deliveries, the BT model preserves the remaining lump -sum water -use quota, thereby preventing severe late-season shortages. In contrast, the CC model maintains relatively high deliveries in the early periods, which exhausts the available quota and leads to pronounced water deficits in the later stages.",agriculture-15-02527.pdf

Figure 10b illustrates the magnitude relationship between the RLSWQ of the BT model and the typical TWV in each period throughout the entire canal scheduling process. It can be seen from Figure 10a that the forecast precipitation is underestimated in earlier periods of the canal schedule (from April to mid -July) and overestimated in later periods (from mid -July to September), which results in the water allocation volume of the CC model being significantly higher in earlier periods and lower in later periods. Figure 10b shows that during the canal scheduling process in 2013, compared to the highest line of TWV of the XH sub -canal and the lowest line of TWV of the DTS sub -canal, the RLSWQ was lower than the TWV in most periods.

In the canal scheduling during the growth stage of this year, the total water allocation volume of the CC model was 3.2 5 × 108 m3, while that of the BT model was 3.5 4 × 108 m3, indicating a relatively low utilization rate of the residual lump -sum water quota for the CC model. Figure 11a shows that the canal scheduling process of the BT model was close to the observed process in 2016. In contrast, Figure 11 b shows that the CC model had less water allocation in earlier periods, and its canal scheduling process was closer to the ob- served process in 2016 in later periods.

As shown in Figure 12a, the canal scheduling process of the CC model exhibits a phenome- non where the water allocation volume is significantly lower in earlier periods and higher in later periods.

Figure 12b shows that the RLSWQ of the BT model is higher than the lowest TWV– the TWV of the DTS sub -canal, and in most periods, it is also higher than the highest one – the TWV of the XH sub -canal. During the canal scheduling process in 2016, the RLSWQ of the BT model was not lower than the TWV from April to late May, allowing it to meet the water demand in this period as much as possible without implementing restricted water allocation. From late May to mid -June, although the RLSWQ was lower than the TWV corresponding to some sub -canals, the water demand was very small at this time, which had little impact on the canal scheduling performance. From late June to the end of the growth stage, the RLSWQ was generally not lower than the TWV, and the canal schedule was also implemented to meet water demand as much as possible.

2,42,"4. Discussion The previous section compared and analyzed the canal scheduling performance of the OC model, the CC model, and the BT model, respectively. From a comprehensive per- spective that includes the richness of information sources, the required lead time for fore- cast information, the transparency of canal scheduling decisions, and overall perfor- mance, the BT model proposed in this study offers advantages such as utilizing diverse information sources, having low requirements for forecast lead time, employing clear ca- nal scheduling rules, and achieving strong canal scheduling performance. The OC and CC models impose stringent requirements on both the accuracy of fore- cast information and the length of the forecast lead time. Specifically, the OC model as- sumes perfectly accurate hydrometeorological forecasts with a sufficiently long lead time—long enough to cover the entire canal scheduling horizon and even the full crop growth period [ 6,38]. For example, Fan et al. [ 38] generated canal -scheduling plans for the wheat greening stage in 2017, the wheat grain -filling stage in 2018, and the wheat greening stage in 2019 in the Bojili Irrigation District, Shandong Province, China; these plans re- quired precise forecasts of crop water demand 20, 10, and 15 days in advance, respectively. Zhou et al. [ 6] developed a canal scheduling plan for autumn irrigation during the non - growing season in the Hetao Irrigation District, which required hydrometeorological fore- casts extending up to two months and assumed complete accuracy. For the CC model, the decision in the first period is identical to that of the OC model and therefore requires the same long forecast lead time. However, as the canal scheduling process evolves and deci- sions are u pdated dynamically, the required forecast lead time for subsequent periods gradually decreases. In contrast, the BT model can effectively integrate",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,43,"two categories of information within the irrigation district —extensive historical canal scheduling records ( TRLSWQ and TWV) and inflow –demand forecast data —to generate robust delivery schedules. Because it updates decisions dynamically on a period -by-period basis, and can even operate with daily updates, the BT model requires only short -term hydrometeorological forecasts, typ- ically with a lead time of just one day. The BT model explicitly defines the canal scheduling rules through two key elements: the TRLSWQ of the water source and the TWV assigned to each canal. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no comparable studies have been reported in the field of irrigation canal scheduling to date [ 10]. A central innovation of this work is the establishment of a hedging-trigger rule based on the relationship between the RLSWQ and the TWV at the beginning of each period (Figure 5). Specifically, hedging is activated when t he RLSWQ falls below the corresponding threshold, resulting in a reduction in the delivery volume at the canal inlet; conversely, hedging is terminated when the RLSWQ exceeds the thresh- old, and water is allocated according to demand. The positions of the TWV curves opti- mized by the BT model for different sub -canals vary. The main reason is that the water demand processes of different sub -canals are distinct, which in turn leads to differences in their contributions to the upper -level objective function valu e in the upper -level model during the calibration process of the BT model. Water shortages in some sub -canals (e.g., XH) will have a greater impact on the overall objective, thus resulting in a higher TWV position; in contrast, the situation is reversed for sub -canals with a lower TWV position (e.g., DTS).

In the domain of reservoir operation, extensive resea rch has explored storing water in advance to mitigate the risk of severe shortages later in the season [ 39–43]. In these studies, hedging is typically triggered when certain diagnostic indicators fall below their respective thresholds. These indicators may include the sum of current reservoir storage and inflow (i.e., water availa- bility) [35], a drought frequency index [ 44], or a drought limit water level [ 45]. In general",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,45,"terms, the “hedging” concept can also be applied to all water supply systems with similar characteristics when addressing the issue of allocating water resources across different periods to maximize overall benefits as much as possible. Unlike many two -stage reser- voir operation models that focus solely on deriving the TWV within hedging rules, the present study employs a Bi-level programming framework to jointly determine the TRLSWQ for each period and the TWV in a coordinated manner [ 46,47]. In contrast, both the CC and OC models determine whether and to what extent water allocation should be reduced in each period by solving complex optimization models, which requires them to be equipped with corresponding computing power at all time s. Additionally, the range of the resulting decisions of the two models cannot be predicted in advance, leading to significant limitations in real-world applications. The BT model, by comparison, provides transparent and operationally interpretable scheduling rules , thereby enhancing the practicality and traceability of irrigation canal scheduling deci- sions. From the perspective of canal scheduling performance in the case study, the BT model performs between the OC model and the CC model. Accurate forecasts are a pre- requisite for the OC model to achieve optimal canal scheduling results. Conducting canal scheduling using dynamically updated information is an effective approach to modifying static canal scheduling plans under forecast errors, thereby guiding actual canal schedul- ing. For example, Puig et al. [ 29] integrated real -time meteorological data from on -site weather stations and utilized low -cost RGB cameras to monitor the dynamic changes in crop green canopy coverage continuously, enabling them to update version 6 of the Aq- uaCrop model dynamically, resulting in an approximate 32% reduction in the recom- mended irrigation amount during the wheat -growing season. However, all dynamically updated canal",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,46,"scheduling models have the problem that, as forecast accuracy decreases, canal scheduling performance deviates more from optimal performance. Among relevant studies, Wang and Cai [ 30] found that formulating irrigation plans using accurate weather forecasts for one week, two weeks, and the entire irrigation season in dry years could increase net profits by 5%, 16%, and 22%, respectively. The BT model addresses the issue of the rapidly diminishing marginal returns of forecasts as the lead time extends by refer- encing both forecast information and the target residual lump -sum water quota simulta- neously. It prevents scenarios where an underes timation of the precipitation forecast in earlier periods leads to excessive increases in water allocation for the current period, re- sulting in no available water for allocation in later periods (Figure 9). Similarly, it avoids situations where an overestimation of the precipitation fo recast in earlier periods leads to excessive reductions in water allocation, resulting in a water surplus that fails to meet the demand during those periods. (Figure 11). The BT model does not necessarily outperform the CC model in terms of canal sched- uling performance under all scenarios. That is because whether the BT model can correctly control the canal scheduling process hinges on the values of TRLSWQ and TWV, which in turn depend on the representativeness of the historical data used for calibration . If the values of TRLSWQ and TWV are excessively high, it may lead to unnecessary restrictions and artificially create water shortage incidents. Similarly, if their values are too low, the RLSWQ will be used up prematurely, resulting in severe water shortage in the later pe- riod. Once there is a significant deviation in the parameters, even with accurate forecast values, the deviation in the canal scheduling process cannot be avoided. Nevertheless, this issue can",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,47,be mitigated by utilizing medium - and long -term hydrometeorological forecasts to optimize the target residual lump -sum water quota dynamically.,agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,48,"5. Conclusions This study proposes a dynamically updated canal system scheduling model that is based on the target residual lump -sum water quota at the beginning of each period and hydrometeorological forecast information. A case study is conducted using the canal scheduling for summer and autumn irrigation in the Yongji main canal and its six sub - canals in the Yongji Irrigation District of Hetao Irrigation Area, Inner Mongolia, China. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) A dynamically updated canal system scheduling strategy is proposed, which incor- porates both the target residual lump -sum water quota at the beginning of each pe- riod and hydrometeorological forecast information. This strategy addresses the lim- itations of cu rrent strategies, which rely solely on water availability and crop water demand forecasts. Specifically, it mitigates issues such as excessive water allocation in earlier periods caused by underestimated precipitation forecasts, which can lead to water shortages in later periods , or excessive restriction in earlier periods caused by overestimated precipitation forecasts, which can lead to water wastage in later periods. This strategy encourages irrigation district managers to thoroughly examine historical canal system scheduling data and plan the canal schedule based on estab- lished rules, enabling them to implement water allocation restriction measures in a timely and ap propriate manner. (2) Canal scheduling rules for the canal system in the Yongji Irrigation District are pro- vided, including the target and threshold water volume at the beginning of each pe- riod, and the degree of restriction applied when hedging is triggered. Compared to the conventional model, the rules reduced the sum of the water shortage index of sub-canals by 22.9% and increased the utilization rate of the residual lump -sum wa- ter quota by 3.9%. (3) The proposed dynamically updated canal scheduling model offers several ad-",agriculture-15-02527.pdf
2,49,"vantages, including the effective use of diverse information sources, minimal lead time requirements for forecast information, clear canal scheduling rules, and achiev- ing good perform ance in optimizing canal scheduling. The “Bi-level, Two -stage” model for dynamically updated canal -system scheduling, established in this study, provides strong theoretical guidance and practical value for ef- ficient canal scheduling in irrigation districts. In future research, it can be combined with theories such as machine learning and intelligent forecasting and control, showing broad prospects.

We included studies that determined the burden of CNCRD listed on the Orphanet’s and/or the Genetic and Rare Diseases",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,2,"information center (GARD) websites. We excluded communicable and occupational diseases, rare cancers, and cost-effectiveness/benefit studies. Two researchers independently screened the identified records and extracted data from the final included studies. We used the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) statement to assess the quality of reporting of the included studies. The data synthesis depicted the studies’ characteristics, their distribution by geographic coverage and the group of disease(s) they focused on, the methods and data input sources used and estimated DALY per case. Results In total, 533 titles were screened, and 18 studies were included. These studies covered 19 different CNCRDs, of which most fell in the disease category “Diseases of the nervous system” . Diverse methodological approaches and data input sources were observed among burden of CNCRD studies. A wide range of DALY per case was observed across the different studies and diseases included. Conclusions A low number of burden of CNCRD studies was observed and most estimates resulted from multi- country studies, underlining the importance of international cooperation to further CNCRD research. This study revealed a lack of epidemiological data and harmonization of methods which hampers comparisons across burden of CNCRD studies.

3,3,"Page 2 of 17 Oliveira et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2024) 19:333 Background Rare diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases that affect a small proportion of the population. The criteria that are used to define a rare disease vary worldwide. In the European Union (EU), a disease is defined as rare if less than 5 in 10,000 people are affected, in China when it affects less than 1 in 10,000 people, and in the United States (US) when it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the country (around 6 in 10,000) [ 1–3]. Currently, after combining different sources, more than 10,000 rare dis - eases have been identified globally, including communi - cable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, most of these diseases are chronic non-communicable diseases and are often progressive and/or degenerative, life-threatening, and often associated with significantly reduced quality of life [ 4–7]. For this reason, estimates of prevalence, incidence and mortality might not fully capture the population health impact of chronic non- communicable rare diseases, as they do not reflect their associated morbidity and disability. The concept of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) was introduced by Murray in 1994 [ 8]. The DALY is a population health metric that summarizes healthy time lost due to morbidity, disability, and premature mortal - ity into a single metric [ 9, 10]. Because of this key fea - ture, the DALY metric allows comparison of the health impact of causes of diseases across populations, and as such provides imperative information for priority setting, equitable resource allocation, and monitoring population health [ 11]. Moreover, DALYs might go beyond other health metrics by enabling the representation of the indi - vidual health impact of a disease through the average DALY per affected individual, namely, DALY per case. Specifically, expressing the DALY",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,4,"per individual case provides a more equitable opportunity for comparing the health impact between rare diseases and with other com - mon diseases as it is not influenced by the prevalence of the disease. The DALY consists of two components, namely Years of Life Lost due to premature mortality (YLL), reflecting the mortality component, and Years Lived with Disability (YLD), reflecting the morbidity component. To calculate YLL, data on mortality, cause of death and age at death per sex are required. On the other hand, the calculation of YLD requires information on the incidence or preva - lence of the disease and its disease stages and patterns over time by age and sex [ 11–13]. Initiatives aiming to assess DALYs of a rare disease might be hampered due to the difficulty to find the required epidemiological data and the complexities of the approach to calculate DALYs. Since the 1990s, the DALY has been used in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study [ 14]. The GBD 2019 study provides the most recent epidemiological estimates and DALY calculations for 369 causes of disease and injuries and 87 risk fac - tors for 204 countries and territories [ 13, 15]. However, estimates for rare diseases are frequently not reported separately, as most are reported in broader GBD cause of disease categories, such as the category “Other neuro - logical disorders” or “Other chronic respiratory diseases” [15]. Additionally, the GBD study provides estimates for common causes of disease, including its variants. How - ever, these variants might affect populations at a differ - ent scale and differ in aetiology, clinical presentation and progression, and/or clinical management (e.g., urticaria and myocarditis) [ 16, 17].

3,5,"methodological approaches that have been used to assess the burden of rare diseases. There - fore, the aim of this systematic literature review was to provide an overview of the studies that estimated DALYs resulting from chronic non-communicable rare dis - eases (CNCRD). The following research questions were addressed: •How many burden of CNCRD studies have been conducted since 1990, and in which region/country and for which CNCRDs have these studies been performed? •Which mortality and morbidity data input sources have been used in burden of CNCRD studies? •Which methodological approaches have been used in order to calculate YLL, YLD, and/or DALY for burden of CNCRD? •What was the DALY per case estimated in each burden of CNCRD study? Methods This systematic literature review was performed accord - ing to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ 18]. We registered the protocol of the present systematic review in the International Prospective Register of Sys - tematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database [ 19], under the ID number CRD42022324960. Search strategy and data sources A librarian from the Erasmus MC medical library was involved in the development of the search strategy, on 10 March 2022. We performed the search in two electronic bibliographic databases, namely, Embase and Medline. The search strategy and its search strings can be found in the supplementary materials. In addition, we performed a grey literature search on 24 March 2022. The grey literature search involved data - bases and websites based on literature recommendations",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,6,"Page 3 of 17 Oliveira et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2024) 19:333 [20] as well as organization’s websites focused on popu - lation health and/or rare diseases, namely the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.S Food and Drug Administra - tion (FDA), the National Organization for Rare Dis - eases (NORD), Genetic and Rare Diseases information center (GARD), European Organisation for Rare Dis - eases (Eurordis) and the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Rare Diseases (MetabERN). Finally, we screened the references of the included papers and the references of studies that determined the impact of all rare diseases, including communicable and non- communicable diseases, in a certain region. Conference and paper abstracts, editorials, and general correspondence presenting disease burden findings from CNCRD were also included. For the identified abstracts, we searched for the corresponding full-text. If the same study was both recognized as an abstract and full text, we only included the full-text of the study. Furthermore, no geographic and language restrictions were applied. We included studies if they had been published between Jan - uary 1990, the decade that the DALY concept was intro - duced, and 10 March 2022, when the search strategy was developed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria In this systematic literature review we included studies that assessed the burden of rare diseases using DALY, and/or YLD and YLL as defined within the DALY frame - work. We considered studies in which the rare disease was listed on the Orphanet’s and/or GARD’s websites as a recognized rare disease. We limited this systematic literature review to studies that assessed the burden of CNCRD. We included chronic diseases that matched the chronic disease definition according to the Friedman et al., 2008 study [ 21], which defined chronic diseases as “lasting 12",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,7,"months or longer , imposing limitations on self-care , independent living and social interactions , and/ or resulting in the need for ongoing medical intervention” . We excluded studies that assessed the burden of commu - nicable or occupational diseases, and diseases related to injuries or risk factors, because the affected proportion of the population, and consequently meeting the defini - tion of rare diseases, may vary widely over time and by geographical region. We excluded studies estimating the burden of rare cancers as most of them have a sub-acute clinical course (characterized by a rapid progression and high mortality rates) due to the lack of treatments and delayed diagnosis [ 22, 23], not matching Friedman’s et al. definition of a chronic disease. However, proliferative but non-malignant disorders were included. In total, 3,888 diseases met our eligibility criterion and were included in the search strategy.We included cost of illness studies that followed the burden of disease approach, assessing DALYs for rare diseases. However, we excluded cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis due to insufficient information on burden of disease methods. We also excluded studies that assessed DALYs due to delayed or lack of health - care access, as those were beyond the scope of this study. Finally, we excluded studies that mentioned DALY, YLL or YLD but did not follow the burden of disease approach, using other formulae to obtain their estimates. Data screening and extraction The screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts was car - ried out by two independent researchers, (CCO and PC). The same researchers (CCO and PC) extracted data inde - pendently from the included studies using an adjusted data extraction excel spreadsheet form based on a pre - vious systematic literature review [ 24].

Any disagreements regarding the selection and extraction steps were solved through debate and, if needed, by the study supervisor (JAH). The data extraction form, including the extracted data, and the definitions of each extracted item are provided as supplementary material. The software used for compil - ing, screening, and selecting the studies to be included for data synthesis was EndNote version 20.0.1. Data synthesis The data synthesis of the included studies depicts the study characteristics, methods and data input sources using tables. Moreover, figures were presented to cap - ture the studies distribution by geographic coverage, publication year, and group of disease(s) it focused on, according to the chapter names of the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) [ 25]. The extracted information on the general study characteristics that was not displayed in the data synthesis was included in the supplementary material (e.g. related to study design, study population and detailed methodological choices). Studies were classified as independent or linked studies. The term ‘independent study’ reflects a single or multi- country study for which researchers independently cal - culated and analyzed YLL, YLD and/or DALY caused by CNCRDs. On the other hand, ‘linked studies’ refers to any single or multi-country study that presented esti - mates or secondary analyses from collaborative initia - tives, such as the GBD study. The data extraction and synthesis were managed with Microsoft Excel 2016. The figure displaying the geo - graphical distribution of the included studies was created using the online tool, Datawrapper [ 26].",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,9,"Page 4 of 17 Oliveira et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2024) 19:333 DALY per case calculation For each study, we determined the DALY per incident or prevalent case and displayed these in a figure. The DALY per case was calculated by using informa - tion provided in the methods and/or results section of the study. If the study provided references for further consultation on sample size and/or prevalence/incidence estimates on which the study was based on, we extracted that information for our DALY per case estimation. To following formulas were used to calculate DALY per case, depending on the information provided: CrudeDALY Numberofaffectedindividuals=DALYpercase OR DALYrate(per100000) PrevalenceorIncidenc erate(per100000)=DALYpercase If the same study reported DALYs for multiple years sep - arately, then only the most recent DALY estimates were used for the DALY per case calculation. Additionally, if estimates for multiple diseases were provided separately, DALY per case was calculated per each disease included in the study. Quality of reporting assessment We used the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) statement to assess the quality of reporting of the included full-text studies. The GATHER statement was developed to moti - vate best reporting practices for studies that calculate health estimates [ 27]. The quality assessment table can be found in the supplementary material. Results Literature search Figure 1 presents an overview of the search and screen - ing strategy performed in this systematic literature review, including the main reasons for exclusion based on eligibility criteria. We identified a total of 641 records via searches in databases Embase and Medline and 71 records via other methods. We screened 533 titles and abstracts. We then assessed 85 studies for eligibility according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main reasons for exclusion were due to duplicates, publication date",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf

In total, we included 18 peer-reviewed studies [ 13, 50–66]. Out of the 18 included studies, five did not have the full-text available at the at the inclusion time criteria and thus, these were included as abstracts [50–52, 56, 60]. Study characteristics Table 1 presents an overview of the characteristics of the 18 included studies that provided 26 different DALY and/or YLD and YLL estimates. Two out of the 18 stud - ies were limited to YLLs [ 60, 61]. On the other hand, five studies provided DALYs, but not YLLs or YLDs [ 52, 55, 57, 63, 65]. Furthermore, the GBD study reported DALYs, YLLs and YLDs for two non-fatal CNCRD diseases (Klinefelter and Turner syndrome), meaning YLL was provided as a null estimate. Out of 18 studies, 16 were independent studies while only two were linked studies [13, 55]. However, out of 26 DALY and/or YLD and YLL estimates, 10 (38.5%) were the result of linked studies, while 16 were derived by independent studies. Seven of the 13 studies with full-text available reported receiving funding. Out of these, six relied on non-profit organizations (NPO) as a funding source [ 13, 55, 61, 63] and/or research fellowships [ 61, 62] and one was funded by pharmaceutical industries [ 53]. Most of the studies were performed as observational studies, with three exceptions: two studies estimated DALYs through simulation studies [ 58, 65] and another study was a Delphi study [ 53].

The time inter - vals displayed in Fig. 2 start in 2007, as no independent CNCRD studies were published before this date, till early 2022, when the search was conducted. Overall, the num - ber of studies estimating DALYs associated with CNCRD has increased over time, varying from the lowest number from 2007 to 2010 and 2011–2014 ( n = 3) to the highest, from 2019 to 2022 period ( n = 7). Number of studies per geographical region Figure 3 shows the geographic distribution of the included CNCRD studies. Of the 18 studies included in this review, four studies were multi-country stud - ies [ 13, 55, 61, 63]. The remaining studies ( n = 14) were performed across 11 countries, namely Belgium, Bra - zil, China, Colombia, Iran, Korea, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Thailand and the United States of America [ 50–54, 56–60, 62, 64–66]. The country with highest number of studies was Portugal ( n = 3) [51, 53, 59]. Additionally, all single country studies were performed in middle ( n = 7) [50, 52, 54, 57, 60, 62, 65] or high ( n = 7) [51, 53, 56, 58, 59, 64, 66] income countries.",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf

Some studies that covered the same disease used the same type of data input sources. This is the case for stud - ies that have estimated DALYs for common variable immunodeficiency disorders as both used data from dis - ease registries. Moreover, both motor neuron diseases and sickle cell diseases studies used multiple data sources. These studies were conducted more recently (from 2016) and/or correspond to linked studies [ 13, 52, 55]. On the contrary, burden of disease studies for multiple sclerosis and hemophilia relied on distinct data sources, namely hospital records, a disease registry and surveys [ 13, 54, 57, 62], and literature, experts and a disease registry [ 53, 58, 64], respectively.Table 1 Overview of burden of CNCRD studies Author(s) Reference time period Geographic coverage Disease(s) included Reported metric(s) Name(s) Abolhassani et al.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorders [ 50, 63], hemophilia [ 53, 58, 64], sickle cell dis - ease [ 13, 52], motor neuron diseases [ 13, 55] and multi - ple sclerosis [ 54, 55, 62] were covered in more than one study. Figure 4 shows that rare diseases falling in the dis - ease category “Diseases of the nervous system” were most frequently studied (n = 7) [13, 51, 54–56, 62], followed by “Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs” (n = 6) [13, 52, 53, 58, 64] and ‘Developmental anomalies” (n = 5) [13, 56]. Data input sources Table 2 presents the data input sources used to inform on incidence/prevalence and morbidity, and mortality associated with the rare disease. According to our find - ings, independent studies relied on a lower number of data sources than linked studies (Table 2). Literature was the most common input source to inform on incidence/ prevalence and mortality ( n = 10) [ 13, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, Fig. 1 Flowchart of the literature search (PRISMA)",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf

Years lived with disability Of the 18 studies, 16 calculated YLDs. In nine stud - ies (56.3%), incidence data were used to calculate YLDs [50, 53, 54, 57, 58, 62, 64–66], whereas in seven studies (43.7%) prevalence data were used [ 13, 51, 52, 55, 56, 59, 63]. Out of these 16 studies, two abstracts did not include any further methodological information used for YLD calculation [ 52, 65]. Of the remaining 14 studies, six developed their own disability weights, based on health- related quality of life data [ 13, 53, 55, 58, 59, 64]. Eight studies used existing disability weights, such as the GBD disability weights ( n = 3) [57, 63, 65], the Dutch disability weights ( n = 2) [50, 66] or Korean disability weights ( n = 2) [54, 62]. The remaining study was an abstract that did not report the disability weight source used [ 51]. Out of the 14 studies which have reported YLD methods, seven used severity distributions, taking into account differ - ent levels of severity of the disease and using disability weights that reflected these difference in severity level [13, 53–55, 64, 66]. Age-weighting and time discounting Age-weighting and time discounting was applied in eight of the 16 studies [ 50, 53, 54, 57, 58, 62, 64, 66]. Moreover, of these eight studies, two reported both DALY estimates with and without age weighting and/or with different time discounting rates (0% and 3% or 1.5% and 3%) [ 53, 58].

The diseases with the highest DALY per incident case (higher than 20 DALY per affected individual) were com - mon variable immune disorders (23.1 DALY per case) [50] and multiple sclerosis (22.9 and 21.7 DALY per case) [54, 62], using an incidence-based approach. The diseases with the highest estimated DALY per prevalent case were neural tube defects disorders, accounting for almost 8 DALY per year [ 13], followed by motor neuron diseases (3.7 DALY per case) [ 13] and linked dystonia-parkinsonism (3.6 DALY per case) [ 51].

Furthermore, the distribution of rare diseases per disease group showed that many cause of disease categories were not repre - sented in the included studies. This finding may indi - cate the predominance of rare diseases in certain disease groups, but could also be an indication of greater aware - ness of certain rare diseases. Reasons for the low num - ber of studies may be the lack of epidemiological data collection, challenges in rare disease case reporting, lack of knowledge regarding the rare disease clinical presen - tation and progression, patients’ quality of life, lack of familiarity of researchers in the field of rare disease with the DALY concept, and lack of funding for rare disease research [ 70–72].

Similarly, time discounting places a higher value on life years closer to the present than the life years lived in the future [ 14, 87, 88].

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2024) 19:333 Methodological design choices Table 3 provides an overview of the methodological design choices made to estimate YLL, YLD and/or DALYs in the included CNCRD studies. Years of life lost From 18 studies, four studies performed their YLL cal - culations using national life tables (representative of the corresponding population) [ 50, 59–61], while nine stud - ies used aspirational life tables (representing the ideal standard) [ 13, 53, 55, 57, 58, 61–63, 66]. Exceptionally, one multiple-country study used different types of life tables to estimate YLL per included country [ 61]. Life tables were not reported in six out of the 18 included for YLL estimation However, of these studies, four were Fig. 3 Number of burden of CNCRD disease studies, per geographic region* *Solely single country studies are presented in the figure Fig. 2 Number of burden of CNCRD disease studies, per 4-year time interval* *Only independent studies are presented in the figure",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,27,"Page 13 of 17 Oliveira et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2024) 19:333 The majority of the studies identified in this system - atic literature review were performed in middle or high income countries, while the remaining were performed at a global level. Moreover, some diseases included in this study met the definition of a rare disease in high/ middle income regions but not in lower income regions. This is the case for sickle cell disease with a prevalence that ranges from 50 to 990 cases per 100,000 individuals in lower income countries, which is almost three times higher than the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease around the world [ 15]. Thus, these findings may reflect that researchers from low income countries face even more challenges in performing research on rare or uncom - mon diseases compared with researchers from middle and high income countries [ 78]. In this study, 12 out of 26 CNCRD DALY estimates (46%) covered multiple coun - tries (Global or Western Europe). This finding may be explained by the fact that for research on rare diseases, the availability of a sample of rare disease patients which represents its rare disease population might require the recruitment of patients from multiple countries and/or the involvement of rare disease experts that are spread across different countries [ 79]. Even though the DALY calculation does not require a minimum sample size, it is important to achieve generalizable and relevant DALY estimates of rare diseases, suitable for comparisons between countries and over time, economic evaluations, and other outputs. For all the reasons mentioned above, this study’s finding underlines the importance of interna - tional cooperation to further rare disease research, glob - ally [ 80, 81]. At the basis of this is the need to facilitate data sharing across borders",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,28,"[ 71, 82]. The overview of data input sources revealed that, unlike burden of disease studies for common diseases, determi - nation of the burden of rare disease relies more on litera - ture and expert opinion, which could lead to inaccurate estimations [ 68, 83]. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports on the difficulty of gathering data in the field of rare diseases [ 71, 75]. In contrast to data input sources, we observed con - siderable variations across CNCRD studies estimating YLL, and/or YLD and DALY. Different life tables were used to calculate YLL. Most studies used aspirational life tables (e.g. GBD or WHO life tables) which assume an ideal standard for life expectancy [ 84]. This ideal stan - dard is derived from the highest life expectancy achieved, approximating the potential biological life expectancy per population [ 85]. In contrast, national life tables reflect current mortality and reflective of a country’s past and current circumstances. However, YLL refer to the future years lost due to past or current premature mor - tality [ 68, 84]. In addition, the use of different life tables hampers international comparisons of DALYs due to rare disease. Therefore we recommend the use of aspirational life tables when calculating YLLs, in order to facilitate international comparisons, and calculate YLL that reflect future years of life lost. Different methodologies were observed for YLD calcu - lations. To start, the disability weights may influence the accuracy of YLD estimates whenever they do not reflect the health problems that are experienced across life or at different stages [ 86]. Furthermore, YLD can either assume an incidence perspective or a prevalence per - spective, while YLL always assume an incidence perspec - tive (inform on years lost in the future). These YLD and YLL perspectives influence",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,29,"the information provided in DALY estimates. Namely, while the DALY per incident case informs on the average healthy life years a person loses in a lifetime, the DALY per prevalent case provides an overview of healthy life year(s) that a person with the disease loses per year, on average. Thus, the DALY per prevalent case (yearly estimate) can account for values higher than one as they include information on time lost in the future (YLL). When it comes to DALY calculations, these can be heavily influenced by applying age weighting and/or time discounting. Age weighting was initially used by the GBD study after studies demonstrating a social preference to value a year lived by a young adult more highly than a year lived by a young child or an older adult [ 14, 87, 88]. Additionally, previous experts have argued in favor of using future time discounting to prevent the current generation from making excessive sacrifices to the point of dedicating all available resources to future health [ 14, 87, 88]. However, both methods were criticized, as it was argued that the DALY was defined as quantifying loss of health, rather than the social value of loss of health and that health cannot be measured with money or rein - vested elsewhere [ 14, 87, 88]. For these reasons and to avoid extra complexity, in 2013 both methods were dis - continued by the GBD [ 83, 89]. In the studies identified in this systematic review, the application of age weigh - ing or time discounting was common, which is explained either by the year of publication - before 2013 - or the fact that the authors aimed to determine both health as economic burden. Nevertheless, whenever applying such methods, unweighted and undiscounted DALY estimates must also be presented in",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,30,"addition, to ensure comparabil - ity with other estimates/studies. Ultimately, the heterogeneity of methodological choices observed in burden of CNCRD studies highlight the need to improve and harmonize burden of rare dis - ease research, by developing a framework and a suitable checklist for assessing the quality of reporting of these studies. Such measures might improve the relevance of DALY estimates which can then be used for comparisons and be retrieved by policymakers and researchers.",s13023-024-03342-3.pdf
3,31,"Page 14 of 17 Oliveira et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2024) 19:333 In this study, we determined DALYs per case to facili - tate comparison of findings across studies and diseases, including common diseases. According to the GBD 2019 study, DALY per case estimates for Diabetes mellitus type 2 are around 0.15 DALY per prevalent case, annually [ 15]. In this systematic review, however, most of the annual DALY per prevalent case estimates for rare diseases largely surpassed the DALY per prevalent diabetes case with up to 52 times higher for neural tube defects. Nota - bly, some differences were observed for different studies that have calculated DALYs for the same rare diseases using the same method. Namely, both multiple sclerosis and hemophilia include different DALY estimates from three different initiatives. The same was observed for two studies that focused on sickle cell disease. As men - tioned in previous sections, the difference in disease burden estimates between studies can be explained by differences in data sources and disease variants distribu - tion and methods used and/or progress of knowledge of the disease, screening and new treatments. This was the case for Hemophilia, as two studies focused in both dis - ease types A and B, while the third study focused merely on type A. Additionally, another likely explanation for hemophilia’s different estimates might be that two studies decided to apply different time discount rates (1.5% ver - sus 3%) while another decided not to apply time discount rates. For multiple sclerosis, progress in new treatments might present a possible explanation for the different estimates obtained, as lower DALYs are observed in most recent studies.

3,32,"- den of CNCRD studies and identifying methodological design choices that have been used to estimate YLL, YLD, and DALY in these studies over the period from 1990 to 2022. A limitation of our study was that it was limited to CNCDs and excluded cancer and occupational diseases. Similarly, we excluded studies which focused on diseases that did not meet Friedman’s chronicity criteria [ 21]. As the definition on chronicity might change per medical field, some diseases labeled as chronic to some profes - sionals might not be present in this review. Another limi - tation of this study stands with the lack of harmonization of terminology of rare diseases which might have led to the omission of some rare disease names in the search strategy. At last, due to the extension of the search terms, the search was only performed in Medline and Embase, which might have led to missing studies present in differ - ent databases.Conclusion In our systematic literature review a low number of bur - den of CNCRD studies was observed, most estimates resulted from multi-country studies, and a lack of epide - miological data and harmonization of data input sources and methodological choices was observed. These results highlight the importance of international cooperation to further CNCRD research, especially in low and middle income countries. Moreover, collaborative initiatives should structure rare diseases focus groups and develop a framework on the burden of rare disease research. Such actions might improve the visibility of the DALY concept among rare disease experts, allowing for more burden of rare disease studies. Consequently, more DALY estimates might raise awareness to the need of funding rare dis - ease research and social support, reducing rare disease patients burden and inequalities.

For these reasons, data on incidence and prevalence of rare diseases might be difficult to obtain. On the other hand, the lack of knowledge among medical professionals regarding the existence and/or clinical presentation of a rare disease may lead to the underdiagnoses of rare dis - ease patients which, in its turn, may lead to underestima - tion of incidence or prevalence of a rare disease, which can then result in underestimation of DALY rates for rare diseases in the population [ 73–76]. Possible strategies to tackle the low number of burden of CNCRD studies are the harmonization of rare disease terminology and case reporting, and the systematic collection of health-related quality of life data through scaled assessments (e.g., patient reported outcome measurements-PROMs) [ 77].

4,1,"The agriculture sector in Jordan is among the most competitive industries, contributing 6% to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [1]. However, when factoring in the indirect contributions of the food sector, agriculture’s share of GDP can rise to between 25% and 30%. In addition, the agriculture and food industries together provide employment for roughly 20% to 25% of the nation’s active workforce [2]. The agriculture sector plays an important socio-economic role, especially in rural areas, where it serves as a primary livelihood for local communities. Jordan’s diverse climatic and geographic zones give the country a unique competitive edge in producing and exporting fresh fruits and vegetables. However, water scarcity poses a critical challenge to its food system. Classified among the most water-deprived nations in the world, Jordan’s annual renewable water resources amount to just 100 cubic meters per person [3]. The agriculture sector is responsible for roughly half of the country’s water consumption, which has been particularly hard hit by limited water availability. Securing adequate freshwater resources-both surface and groundwater-remains one of the sector’s most pressing concerns. Beyond water scarcity, the agriculture sector in Jordan faces several interconnected challenges. These are the rapid depletion of highland aquifers due to overuse, inefficient and wasteful irrigation practices, soil degradation, climate change impacts, advancing desertification, loss of fertile topsoil, saltwater intrusion into freshwater reserves, rising crop water requirements, and the gradual exhaustion of water sources for irrigation [4]. Jordan’s cultivated land covers approximately 221,000 hectares, of which about 141,000 hectares are rain-fed. These are primarily planted with olives, cereals (wheat and barley), and fruit trees (citrus, grapes, bananas, date palms, stone fruits, pomegranates, figs, apples, and strawberries). The remaining 80,000 hectares are irrigated, mainly producing vegetables (tomato, potato, cucumber, beans, onion, eggplant, squash, and leafy greens) and fruit trees [5]. In the",论文1_1.txt
4,2,"livestock sector, the total number of sheep, goats, and cows amounted to 3,000,000, 765,000, and 78,000, respectively [5]. The scarcity of cultivable land has led to low domestic agricultural output and a heavy reliance on imported food, posing a major challenge to Jordan’s agricultural sector. Jordan was able to achieve varying levels of self-sufficiency across different commodities. For instance, self-sufficiency stands at 26% for red meat, 80% for poultry, 100% for cow’s milk, 89% for fruits including olives, 133% for vegetables, and 100% for table eggs [4]. Jordan’s agricultural sector is characterized by a large proportion of small-scale farms, which are a vital component of the country’s agriculture and play a significant role in sustaining rural livelihoods. In 2017, the total number of agricultural holdings was approximately 107,700, of which over 88% covered less than 3 hectares. For more than 16% of farming households in Jordan, agriculture remains the primary source of income [5]. To a remarkable degree, in Jordan, the situation of small-scale farmers is shaped by farm size, production systems, land tenure, and crop types. Key challenges include limited capacity to adopt modern practices, high indebtedness, land fragmentation, restricted market access, and declining export opportunities due to regional political instability. The scarcity of responsive extension and rural advisory services, coupled with the absence of reliable market information systems, weakens farmers’ bargaining power and market participation. These constraints heighten vulnerability to external shocks, reduce productivity, and limit profitability. Small-scale farmers largely operate at the bottom of the value chain, capturing minimal value due to information asymmetry, weak collective action, and poor market integration. Limited assets and low productivity further restrict their access to finance, as their activities are often deemed high-risk and difficult to monitor [6]. The agriculture sector in Jordan operates under a loan-pricing system that adjusts based",论文1_1.txt
4,3,"on the risk associated with specific crops, locations, and financial products. In some situations, this results in more favorable terms for certain farmer groups, crop types, or regions. In others, it leads to steeper borrowing costs due to heightened risks of default or loss. Farmers across the country contend with multiple structural and operational hurdles. These include restricted market access for their agricultural produce, insufficient tools and mechanisms to manage production and price risks, and limited access to financing and essential inputs. These constraints impact the stability of domestic food supplies and contribute to persistent challenges around rural income generation and poverty reduction. Availability of credit and broader financial services is essential for enabling farm-level investments that drive productivity, generate employment, support rural livelihoods, and ensure smoother income flows. These outcomes, in turn, enhance market engagement and risk mitigation [7]. Financial access is also a crucial enabler of agricultural adaptation to climate change, strengthening the sector’s ability to withstand environmental shocks and thereby securing long-term food availability [8]. Despite its importance, access to diverse and appropriate financial products remains a major obstacle for small-scale farmers who make up the bulk of Jordan’s farming population. It is crucial to understand the various profiles of small-scale families and the conditions and market context in which they operate. Small-scale farmers are mostly affected by the availability and quality of financial services that are key to increasing farm productivity, profitability, and income [9]. Small-scale farmers require services that equip them with information, knowledge, and skills that enable them to cope with diverse production and marketing challenges. This entails a wide range of financial services that facilitate business and market orientation, addressing aspects such as improving farm business management, postharvest handling, linking to input and output markets, and providing digital solutions to access information and",论文1_1.txt
4,4,"alternative markets. The government of Jordan, through the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC), has made an effective contribution to agricultural development and food security. It does so by providing the necessary funds Government-Backed Loans Program in Supporting Small-Scale Farmers 3 and loans for crop cultivation and livestock breeding. Agricultural lending is indeed a critical mechanism for raising agricultural growth rates [7]. Loans play a crucial role in enabling farmers to increase the assets available for use in production. These assets can then be invested in infrastructure and the implementation of productive projects within the sector. This, in turn, would increase the production performance of small agricultural enterprises. It also strengthens their ability to manage debt, which is necessary to deal with downsizing seasons and other challenges confronting the agriculture sector. To this end, this paper focuses on the impacts of agricultural loans that enhance farmers' financial capacity. More specifically, it focuses on how small-scale farmers use these loans to purchase productive inputs and achieve optimal agricultural production. These loans are crucial, especially in rural communities that depend on agriculture as their main source of income. To date, there has been limited scholarly investigation into the experiences of small-scale farmers who operate independently of formal value chains and have minimal engagement in commercial agricultural activities. Little is known about their access to any financial services or the specific products and services they demand in Jordan. A report by Palladium Europe BV highlighted that small-scale farmers in Jordan with viable business cases face significant challenges in obtaining financial services, citing high collateral requirements and interest rates [10]. Another study emphasized the importance of agricultural loans in Jordan but noted disparities in loan distribution, with small landowners favoring medium-term loans [11]. These findings suggest a gap in research specifically addressing the financial access and",论文1_1.txt

In general, there is a lack of comprehensive insight into the range of financial options available to small-scale farmers in Jordan. Additionally, how credit constraints hinder agricultural progress and threaten national food security. Additionally, little is known about financial practices beyond the realm of commercial farming and the tight value chain segment. In response, the research objectives of this study aim to: 1) investigate the agricultural loan system in Jordan, including its operations, lending methodologies, and the types of farmers it serves; 2) explore the financial needs and demands of small-scale farmers, including value chain financing requirements; and 3) discuss the impact of government-backed loans and identify best practices for supporting small-scale farmers through agricultural lending programs.",论文1_1.txt

5,2,"the incidence rate, prevalence rate, mortality rate, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate of EO-CRC were estimated at 5.37 (95%UI: 4.91 to 5.86)/100,000, 34 (95%UI: 30.96 to 37.35)/100,000, 2.01 (95%UI: 1.84 to 2.19)/100,000, and 101.37 (95%: 92.85 to 110.18)/100,000 in 2021. The prevalence and incidence rates of EO-CRC showed an ascending trajectory, whilst the DALYs and mortality rates demonstrated a downward tra- jectory between 1990 to 2021. The high-middle SDI regions and East Asia exhibited the highest EO-CRC burden among the five SDI regions and 21 GBD regions respectively. A low-whole-grains diet was the chief risk factor contrib - uting to EO-CRC. It was predicted that the age-standardized rate (ASR) of EO-CRC incidence would increase by 5.56%, while the ASR of mortality would decrease by 13.9% globally until 2036. Conclusion The current and future global burden of EO-CRC is heavy and varies significantly across different regions and countries.

However, recent data show a significant increase in the incidence of gas - trointestinal cancers among individuals under 50 years old, including esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and biliary tract cancers, collectively referred to as early- onset gastrointestinal cancers (EO-GICs) [2–4]. EO-GICs often exhibit poorer pathological features and progno - sis compared to those occurring in older age groups. Moreover, they are more likely to be overlooked in early screening [3]. The rising incidence of these EO-GICs has emerged as a significant public health challenge. Early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is one of the EO-GICs that exhibiting the most significant increase in the incidences and mortality rates in the past three decades [4]. The incidence of EO-CRC is steadily rising in Europe and the United States, with projections indi - cating an approximate doubling by 2030 [5]. Australia has also observed a significant increase in colon cancer cases among individuals under 50 years old [6]. Further - more, in the Caribbean and Latin American regions, CRC incidence among individuals aged 15–49 has dou - bled from 1990 to 2019 [7]. The Asia–Pacific region has experienced substantial growth in EO-CRC rates as well, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, which showed age-standardized incidence rate increases of 16.9% and 26.2%, respectively, between 2010 and 2019 [8]. East Asia had the highest incidence rate, mortality rate, and the fastest increase in EO-CRC among all GBD regions in 2019 [7]. Compared to CRC occurring in older individuals, EO- CRC is more likely to exhibit aggressive pathological features such as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell carcinoma, as well as lymphovascular and perineural invasion [9]. These characteristics pose greater challenges for treatment and result in worse treatment",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf

Despite receiving intensive treatment, these patients exhibited a higher recurrence rate and a lower 5-year sur - vival rate [11]. Most EO-CRC cases are sporadic and lack a genetic or familial background, indicating that acquired factors such as diet, lifestyle, and environment may con - tribute significantly. It is imperative to conduct further epidemiological studies and research into risk factors in order to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and develop effective prevention strategies [4]. Although some previous studies have examined the global burden of EO-CRC, the data they used was obtained from the GBD Study 2019, which was published two years ago. Previous studies often focused on a spe - cific population in certain regions or within a certain age range [12–15]. The new data from the GBD Study 2021 was released recently, and there is currently no compre - hensive report on the global disease burden of EO-CRC based on this data. Consequently, we conducted this analysis of the global EO-CRC burden, including its dis - tribution across various countries and regions, between 1990 and 2021 [16]. Moreover, we investigated poten - tial risk factors associated with EO-CRC. Additionally, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was employed to forecast the burden over the next fifteen years. The findings of our analysis will play a crucial role in informing decision-makers and the pub - lic, helping formulate evidence-based public policies, efficiently allocate resources for cancer prevention, and reduce exposure to EO-CRC risk factors.

5,6,"conduct joinpoint regression analysis in order to evalu - ate trends in the disease burden of EO-CRC. This soft - ware analyzes data trends over time by fitting multiple line segments using a logarithmic scale. Average Annual Percentage Changes (AAPCs) and Annual Percentage Change (APC) were used to evaluate the trends in vari - ation [19]. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was deter - mined using a linear regression model. An increase in age-standardized rate (ASR) is associated with a positive AAPC value and its corresponding 95% CI above zero. Conversely, a decrease in ASR is associated with a nega - tive AAPC value and its corresponding 95% CI below zero [20]. Risk factors The GBD Study 2021 provides access to 11 risk factors associated with EO-CRC, which are broadly classified into three primary categories: dietary-related factors, metabolic factors, and behavioral factors. Dietary-related factors included a low-calcium diet, low-fiber diet, low- milk diet, low-whole-grain diet, high-processed-meat diet, and high-red-meat diet. Metabolic factors included high fasting plasma glucose and high body mass index (BMI). Behavioral factors included low physical activ - ity, high alcohol use, and smoking [17, 21]. Explanations and methods for estimating the contribution of these risk factors to the EO-CRC burden have been extensively dis - cussed in prior scholarly works [17, 22]. In summary, the GBD Study 2021 utilized an established risk assessment framework to calculate the proportion of the EO-CRC burden associated with each individual risk factor. Prediction The ARIMA model is composed of the autoregres - sive model and the moving average model, which are combined to form the ARIMA model. The fun - damental presumption is that data sequences are stochastic variables dependent on time, with their auto - correlation describable through the ARIMA model, enabling the prediction of future values based on pre",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf

In this equation, ( φ1Yt-1+φ2Yt-2+...+φpYt-p+et ) is the component of the autoregressive model, while ( et−θ1et-1−...−θqet-q ) represents the moving average part. The value observed during period (t-p) is repre - sented by (Yt-p), and p and q represent the model orders of the autoregressive and moving average components, with et representing the unpredictable deviation occur - ring during time period t [23]. The ARIMA model neces - sitates that the time series be a stochastic sequence with a mean of zero and demonstrate stationarity. We employed R version 4.3.2 for all statistical analyses and graphical representations. Results Global burden of EO‑CRC Worldwide, from 1990 to 2021, the EO-CRC incidence shows a marked upward trajectory (Fig. 1a, Table 1).

By sex, in 2021, the preva - lence cases and prevalence rate for males were 803,681 (95% UI: 698,587 to 923,434) and 40.19 (95% UI: 34.93 to 46.18)/100,000, respectively, which were higher than those for females, 538,787 (95% UI: 492,036 to 591,352) and 27.65 (95% UI: 25.25 to 30.34)/100,000. The AAPC of the prevalence rate for males was 1.82% (95% CI: 1.6% to 2.04%) during 1990 to 2021, which was higher than that for females, 1.02% (95% CI: 0.9% to 1.15%) (Fig. 1b and Table 2). As illustrated in Fig. 1c and Table 3, the number of deaths due to EO-CRC increased from 59,232 (95% UI: 54,391 to 63,963) in 1990 to 79,504 (95% UI: 72,699 to 86,539) in 2021; nevertheless, the mortality rate declined from 2.19 (95% UI: 2.01 to 2.36)/100,000 in 1990 to 2.01 (95% UI: 1.84 to 2.19)/100,000 in 2021, with an AAPC of -0.23% (95% CI: -0.34% to -0.12%).

The AAPC was -0.31% (95% CI: -0.46% to -0.16%). From a gender perspective, the DALYs and DALYs rate for males were significantly higher than those for females (Fig. 1d and Table 4). EO‑CRC burden by regions As exhibited in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and Fig. 2, the high-middle SDI region exhibited the heaviest EO-CRC burden among all SDI regions, while the low SDI region showed the lightest burden. Specifically, the high-middle SDI region exhibited the maximal prevalence rate (2.72/100,000, 95% UI: 2.56 to 2.88), mortality rate (3.09/100,000, 95% UI: 2.72 to 3.53), and DALYs rate (155.3/100,000, 95% UI: 136.66 to 177.18); whereas the low SDI region exhibited the minimal incidence rate (1.3/100,000, 95% UI: 1.12 to 1.49), prevalence rate (5.86/100,000, 95% UI: 5.07 to 6.68), mortality rate (0.93/100,000, 95% UI: 0.8 to 1.08), DALYs rate (47.47/100,000, 95% UI: 40.89 to 55.15), AAPC for the incidence rate (-0.02%, 95% CI: -0.16 to 0.12%), and AAPC for the prevalence rate (0.35%, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.5%). The APCs of incidence and prevalence rates in high SDI regions were -1.74% and -1.68% from 2018 to 2021 respectively. The detailed data of EO-CRC burden in the 21 GBD regions of the world from 1990 to 2021 are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 .

Additionally, a diet low in calcium was sig - nificantly higher than other risk factors in middle-low and low SDI regions, as well as in most African regions (Fig. 8a and Fig. S1). After analyzing the changes in each risk factor from 1990 to 2021, we found that two meta - bolic factors, high BMI and high fasting plasma glucose, showed the fastest growth globally, particularly in mid - dle, low-middle, and low SDI regions such as East Asia, Southeast Asia, and some African regions. Meanwhile, these regions experienced a substantial rise in high alco - hol use (Figs. 8b and 9). Stratified analysis by age and gender indicated that smoking and high alcohol use had a much higher impact on males with EO-CRC compared to females; the smoking factor was significantly higher among individuals aged 40–49 compared to those aged 15–39 (Fig. S2).Prediction The estimated worldwide incidence ASR of EO-CRC is projected to be 5.42 /100,000 in 2036, reflecting a growth rate of 5.56% from 2021 (Fig. 10a). The projected mortality ASR of EO-CRC for 2036 is estimated to be 1.66/100,000, reflecting a decline of 13.85% compared to 2021 (Fig. 10b). From 2021 to 2036, the incidence ASR among males is predicted to be greater than that among females. In males, the projected incidence ASR in 2036 is estimated to be 6.72/100,000, reflecting a growth of 10.3%. Conversely, the incidence ASR in females is expected to remain consistent with that observed in 2021 at 4.16/100,000. From 1990 to 2015, the mortality ASR of EO-CRC in males exhibited a decrease compared to that observed among females.

We found that the three major risk factors contributing to DALYs for EO-CRC worldwide in 2021 were a diet low in whole grains (17%), a diet low in milk (15.8%), and a diet high in red meat (13.8%) (Fig. 8a).

5,26,"Page 12 of 20 Zhang et al. BMC Public Health (2024) 24:3124 in the other four SDI regions continued to increase rap - idly during the same period. This suggests that health - care measures in high SDI regions have yielded effective results in recent years, which may serve as a reference for research and practice in other regions. Over the past three decades, EO-CRC has shown the most rapid increase in high-middle SDI regions, while demonstrat - ing the slowest growth rate in low SDI regions. This may be attributed to the rapid industrialization in high- middle SDI regions, leading to lifestyle changes such as increased consumption of red meat, alcohol, processed food, and cigarettes, alongside a decrease in physical activity and an increase in obesity rates. These factors potentially contribute to an elevated risk of EO-CRC [32, 33]. Furthermore, advancements in medical screening technologies may also result in a higher number of EO- CRC cases being diagnosed in high-middle SDI regions [7]. Conversely, due to limited healthcare resources and lower levels of medical expertise, many cases of early- onset CRC remain undiagnosed or unregistered in low SDI areas [34, 35]. While the burden of EO-CRC in lower SDI regions is currently lower, it is essential to consider the rising trends in alcohol consumption and metabolic risk factors. Recent studies indicate significant increases in metabolic disorders and alcohol-related complica - tions in these regions [36–38], which may contribute to a future rise in EO-CRC cases. Therefore, caution is war - ranted against overly optimistic conclusions regarding the current burden. Proactive public health strategies and continued monitoring are crucial to address these emerg - ing risks in vulnerable populations. There are notable differences in the disease burden of EO-CRC across different continents and countries, even among regions with similar SDI",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf

5,28,"Similarly, the mortality ASR of females is projected to decrease significantly by 10.4% to 1.41/100,000 in 2036. Discussion EO-CRC has attracted significant concern in recent years, driven not only by its rapidly increasing incidence but also by several other critical factors. First, EO-CRC predominantly affects individuals under the age of 50, who often serve as primary breadwinners and essential contributors to society. Their illness impacts not only their health but also the well-being of their families and the broader community [24, 25]. Second, patients with EO-CRC are more susceptible to psychological issues, sexual dysfunction, and fertility challenges compared to those with traditional colorectal cancer, leading to a diminished overall quality of life [26]. Third, clinical stud - ies indicate that EO-CRC patients present with more adverse pathological features, higher rates of chemother - apy resistance, increased recurrence rates, and poorer prognoses than their traditional colorectal cancer coun - terparts [9, 27–29]. Finally, emerging research reveals that EO-CRC involves distinct mechanisms of develop - ment, risk factors, pathophysiology, and genomic char - acteristics compared to traditional colorectal cancer. This highlights the urgent need for targeted research focused specifically on early-onset colorectal cancer [9–11]. As shown in our study, the global incidence and preva - lence of EO-CRC have exhibited a rapid increasing trend from 1990 to 2021, which is consistent with previous research [ 30, 31]. However, we further observed that the trend shifted to a decline from 2019 to 2021, as indicated by corresponding APC values of less than zero. Further analysis shows that this declining trend occurred only in high SDI regions, while the incidence and prevalence Fig. 4 Prevalence rates (a) and average annual percent changes (AAPCs) (b) of early-onset colorectal cancer in 204 countries and territories",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf
5,29,"has suggested that in East Asia, race plays an important role in the development of CRC. Certain ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese, have higher inci - dence rates of CRC. Even in countries like Singapore and Malaysia, where diverse racial populations live in simi - lar environments and dietary habits, the risk of CRC is significantly increased among Chinese compared to Malays and Indians. Furthermore, within the same eth - nic group in China, individuals residing in coastal areas exhibit higher incidence and mortality rates than those living inland [39, 40]. The screening guidelines for CRC of different countries may impact the burden of EO- CRC. Most countries recommend CRC screening for the general risk population starting at age 50 [41]. With increasing focus on EO-CRC, the Chinese CRC Screen - ing Guidelines lowered the starting age for screening in the general risk population to 40 in 2020 [42]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommen - dation also reduced the initial screening age from 50 to 45 for CRC in 2021 [43, 44]. Adults aged 40 and above were required to undergo routine screenings for CRC in Japan since 1992 [41]. We found that the ranks of EO- CRC mortality in Japan, China, and the USA were much lower than those of their corresponding incidence rates. Research by indicated that Japan had the lowest mortal - ity-to-incidence ratio of EO-CRC in Asia from 1990 to 2019 [45]. This suggests that while early screening might not reduce the incidence of EO-CRC, it can lower the risk of fatal outcomes from CRC. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings in the future. Our study found that although the incidence, preva - lence, mortality, and DALYs of EO-CRC have shown a rapid increase over the past",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf

5,31,"Page 14 of 20 Zhang et al. BMC Public Health (2024) 24:3124 result reflects that the growth rate of the disease burden associated with EO-CRC is relatively slower compared to that of all CRC cases. Similar findings have been reported in other studies [13, 34]. This may be due to age being one of the risk factors for CRC, combined with the increase in life span and the effects of population aging [31]. Con - sequently, CRC in older populations is also a significant public health concern that requires focused attention. Through our analysis of risk factors, we found that a diet low in whole grains, a diet low in milk, and a diet high in red meat have consistently been the major risk factors for DALYs in EO-CRC patients worldwide, regardless of whether in developed or low-income regions from 1990 to 2021. Similar results have also been reported in previous literature [7 , 35]. According to another study [46], 21.5% of global gastrointestinal cancer cases in 2018 were attributable to poor dietary habits, with excessive processed meat consumption and insufficient fruit and whole grain intake being major risk factors. Therefore, encouraging people to increase their consumption of whole grains and milk while reducing their intake of red meat can help lower the global disease burden of EO-CRC. It is also worth noting that from 1990 to 2021, the two metabolic fac - tors, high BMI and high fasting plasma glucose, were the fastest-growing risk factors for DALYs in EO-CRC patients globally, especially in economically underde - veloped middle, low-middle, and low SDI regions such as East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central and Eastern sub-Saharan Africa. We also observed a significant increase in high alcohol use in these regions. This indicates that the disease burden of early-onset colorectal",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf
5,32,"cancer caused by high BMI and high fast - ing plasma glucose has increased significantly over the past 30 years. This also corroborates the earlier findings by Tan et al. regarding GBD2019 [47], which reported a substantial rise in the global cancer-related mortal - ity burden attributable to high BMI from 2010 to 2019, including cancers of the liver, colorectal, esophagus, and breast. In recent years, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer has significantly increased, closely associated with changes in various risk factors. Notably, the rising trends in alcohol consumption and inflam - matory bowel disease (IBD) may play critical roles in this phenomenon [48, 49]. Research indicates that the increase in alcohol consumption among younger populations is significantly linked to the rising rates of early-onset colorectal cancer. Metabolites of alco - hol can cause DNA damage in intestinal cells, thereby increasing the risk of malignant transformation.

5,33,"Moreover, alcohol consumption may alter the gut microbiome and promote inflammatory responses, fur - ther compromising gut health [48, 50]. Concurrently, the prevalence of IBD continues to rise among young individuals. Chronic intestinal inflammation is recog - nized as a major contributing factor to colorectal can - cer development. Studies have shown that individuals with IBD have a significantly higher risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to the general population, particularly with prolonged disease duration. There - fore, early identification and management of IBD might be crucial in reducing the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer [49, 51]. Furthermore, high alcohol consump - tion can also increase the risk of obesity [24], which further raises the risks of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and other metabolic factors [52]. Reports show that obe - sity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia are independent risk factors for EO-CRC [53– 55]. Thus, urgent measures are needed to reduce obesity and alcohol consumption, particularly among teenagers. Low and middle-low SDI regions, such as East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central and Eastern sub-Saharan Africa, should pay more attention to this issue and implement effec - tive measures. Moreover, the conclusions of our study still need further research to be substantiated. We projected the global burden of EO-CRC beyond 2021, covering a period of 15 years. Our concern lies in the predicted 5.56% increase in the ASR of EO-CRC inci - dence after this timeframe. Notably, the ASR of EO-CRC incidence among males is expected to rise by 10.3%, sur - passing the corresponding change observed in females. This finding aligns with previous relevant studies and underscores the urgent need to enhance colonoscopy screening and early detection measures for CRC, while Fig. 8 Percentage contribution of 11 risk factors to the DALYs of EO-CRC globally, by SDI quintiles, in 1990 and",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf

5,35,"intensifying health education about the associated risk factors to effectively prevent CRC occurrence, particu - larly among males [14]. Fortunately, there is an estimated reduction of 13.9% in the ASR of EO-CRC mortality in 2036. Notably, this decline is more significant among females than among males. These results are aligned with the findings noted in previous pertinent research and can be attributed to advancements in the treatment of CRC as well as an increased focus on promoting a healthy diet among women [56]. The innovations of this study are as follows: this is the first study analyzing the global burden and cross- country health inequalities of EO-CRC from 1990 to 2021 utilizing newly published data derived from the GBD Study 2021. Moreover, we conducted in-depth analyses of the percentage contribution and trends of risk factors for EO-CRC, stratified by sex and age. Admittedly, there are several limitations in this study. Firstly, the GBD data we used has a wide range of time spans and spatial spans, inevitably leading to variations in measurement standards. In addition, the rigor and completeness of data registration may vary across dif - ferent regions, which can potentially interfere with the analysis results [16, 35]. Secondly, The GBD database is unable to evaluate demographic factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity, as well as comorbidities like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. These factors are crucial in understanding the epidemiology of EO-CRC, as they may influence risk factors and disease outcomes. Future research should aim to incorporate demographic fac - tors and comorbidities to enhance our understanding of the disease and inform prevention and treatment strategies more effectively [57, 58]. Thirdly, when con - ducting the analysis of risk factors, using age-standard - ized rates may lead to an underestimation of the true risk for certain factors highly",s12889-024-20624-4.pdf
5,36,"correlated with specific age groups. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the GBD database exhibits significant differences in data quality and collection methods compared to other databases, such as SEER (Surveillance, Epidemi - ology, and End Results) and GLOBOCAN (Cancer’s Global Cancer Observatory). The GBD database inte - grates various data sources, including hospital records, death certificates, and survey data, aiming to estimate the global burden of disease through modeling. How - ever, this reliance on models may lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of specific diseases [1 , 16]. Moreover, the SEER database is primarily based on cancer regis - tries in the United States, providing detailed epidemio - logical data for American cancer patients, but it has a relatively smaller sample size, covering only about 34% of the population [59]. In contrast, GLOBOCAN relies on reports from national cancer registries, with a lower frequency of data updates, potentially impacting the timeliness and accuracy of global cancer burden assess - ments [50]. Consequently, the results derived from the GBD database may be influenced by data quality con - siderations stemming from these differences in sample size and data update frequency. According to previ - ous studies, the incidence for most digestive cancers, including CRC, in GBD 2019 were lower than those in GLOBOCAN 2020 in Asia [60]. Therefore, these limi - tations may influence our assessment of the burden of EO-CRC. At last, given the variations in data sources and analytical methods among these databases, future research should approach the interpretation and com - parison of results from different datasets with caution. Conclusion In brief, our findings indicated that the incidence and prevalence rates of EO-CRC exhibited an upward trend, while the mortality and DALYs rates demonstrated a downward trajectory from 1990 to 2021 globally.

5,37,"disease burden among the five SDI regions occurred in the high-middle SDI region in 2021, while East Asia demonstrated the highest mortal - ity rate, incidence rate, and DALYs rate among the 21 GBD regions. Dietary risk factors, such as a diet low in whole grains, a diet low in milk, and a diet high in red meat, were primary factors contributing to the DALYs of EO-CRC. The two metabolic factors, high BMI and high fasting plasma glucose, were the fastest-growing risk fac - tors contributing to DALYs in EO-CRC patients globally from 1990 to 2021. In the next 15 years, the ASR of inci - dence is projected to increase by 5.56%, while the ASR of mortality is expected to decrease by 13.9%. The current and future burdens of EO-CRC remain substantial at the global, regional, and national levels, displaying significant variation across different regions and nations. Countries should promptly develop strategies to allo - cate healthcare resources based on their disease burden and implement effective prevention and early screening measures.

This systematic review evaluates the effect of free ARVs, without out-of-pocket cost to the patient, on the HIV cascade of care: the use of ARV therapy, viral suppression and the use of pro- phylaxis (PrEP).Methods: The following databases were searched for publications between 1 January 1996 and 10 July 2024: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CNKI, Global Index Medicus, the Web of Science, the SciELO Citation Index and grey litera- ture. Publications were eligible if they included people living with or at risk of HIV and compared free access to ARVs with out-of-pocket fees. Reviewers screened publications that focused on the outcomes: being on therapy, being virally suppressed and being on PrEP. The National Heart, Lung and BloodInstitute (NHLBI) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Quality Assessment Tools were used to assess publication quality. Results: A total of 34164 documents were identi fied, and 407 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 22 publications m et the inclusion criteria. In six of the seven publications reporting on being on therapy, providing free ARVs increasedthe number of people who received treatment. All four publications reporting on viral suppression showed improvement with free access. Additionally, both publica- tions reporting on PrEP use",HIV-26-1329.pdf

6,3,"INTRODUCTION The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and WHO 95-95-95 strategy for 2030 —aimed at ensuring 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% ofthose diagnosed receive sustained treatment and 95% of those on treatment achieve viral suppression —has been adopted by many countries to end the AIDS pandemic.However, global progress towards ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic remains incomplete, with many countries still struggling to meet international targets [ 1]. Indeed, according to WHO data from 2023, 89% of people livingwith HIV were receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, and 93% had achieved viral suppression, both falling short of the 95-95-95 targets set for 2030 [ 2]. Although there is a global decline in the number of new infections, reports indicate that some regions, such as the United States, con- tinue to experience an increase [ 1]. One key concern is access to ARV drugs, which are both life-saving and essential for preventing transmission [1, 2]. Many public organizations, including the WHO and UNAIDS, advocate for free access to ARVs, a key component of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), to improve treatment uptake and retention in care [ 1, 3]. However, access policies vary widely across countries andeven regions of the same country [ 4–6]. In North Amer- ica, accessing medication often involves out-of-pocket fees [ 7, 8]. In contrast, countries like Brazil and most Western European nations provide free ARVs [ 9, 10 ]. This lack of consensus may stem from the fact that research findings remain fragmented in the literature.Indeed, a wide range of publications show that cost has an impact on willingness to take pre-exposure prophy- laxis (PrEP), adherence to ARV drugs, financial burdenand retention in care [ 11–18]. However, public authori- ties may view these outcomes as indirect indicators rather than direct measures of progress towards",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,4,"their countries' goals. It is therefore crucial to determine whether providing free ARVs would effectively contribute to achieving the 95-95-95 targets and reducing the number of new infec-tions. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on the impact of providing free ARV drugs on the HIV care cascade (being on therapy and being virally sup-pressed) and on PrEP use. METHODS This systematic review was conducted based on theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-tions and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Revi ews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [ 19]a n dw a sr e g i s t e r e di n the International Prospect ive Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42024527274) [ 20]. Search strategy The following sources were searched: MEDLINE,Embase, CINAHL Complete, the Web of Science Core Collection, the SciELO Citation Index, Global Index Med- icus and CNKI. The searches were executed by AB, ahealth librarian, on 22 January 2024 and were rerun from4 July to 10 July 2024 (see PRISMA-S, items 8 and 13). Searches were limited to publications from 1996 onwards to include only the period after the introduction of highlyactive antiretroviral therapy (ART). No limitations by language of publication were applied. Grey literature, tar- geting HIV-related health organizations and governmentsites of countries which provide free access to ARVs, was also searched. Our search was supplemented by screen- ing the reference lists of publications included in our sys-tematic review. Our search strategies in the databases and grey literature are available via Borealis, in accor- dance with PRISMA-S [ 21, 22 ]. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and outcomes Publications were eligible if they reported either on people living with HIV or at risk of acquiring HIV from1996 onwards. No restrictions were applied based on the number or age of participants. Our exposure of",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,5,"interest was free access to ARV drugs, defined asobtaining or providing ARV drugs without any directcosts for the end-user (e.g. , no co-payment, deductible or purchase fees). Free access to ARVs needed to be specified or clearly implied and compared to any typeof out-of-pocket (OOP) costs. Causal claims made by the authors on the relationship were not considered when reviewing studies for inclusion, recognizing thatdifferent study designs (e.g., observational studies, modelling studies) contribute to valuable but varying levels of causal inference. Moreover, publications were included if they reported at least one of our primary outcomes (being on therapy, defined as the initiation or uninterrupted use of ART; being virally suppressed, defined as the last viral load ≤200 copies/mL or the absence of viro- logical failure; and being on PrEP, defined as receiving uninterrupted HIV PrEP accord ing to the local guidelines) or at least one of our secondary outcomes (incident HIVinfection; mortality). Studi es were grouped for synthesis according to these outcomes.1330 DOUTRE ET AL .",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,6,"Selection of publications and data extraction Screening of titles and abstracts (ID, MD, MPG, BL, RR and ZER) and full text (ID, MD, MPG and BL) was doneindependently by two reviewers. Data extraction was undertaken independently by two reviewers (ID, MD and MPG). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or byadjudication with a senior investigator (BL). Screening and extraction were facilitated using a web-based system- atic review workflow application (Covidence, VeritasHealth Innovation Ltd). Quality assessment The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)Study Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess thequality of cohort, cross-sectio nal and ecological studies as well as modelling publications [ 23]. The quality of quasi- experimental studies was assessed using the Joanna BriggsInstitute (JBI) checklist [ 24]. The assessment was done inde- pendently by two reviewers (MD, MPG) and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data items The synthesis of publications was stratified according to outcomes. Data extracted included the characteristics of the publication (authors' name, year of publication, coun-try, number of patients, design, study period, population receiving free ARVs or paying OOP fees and outcome type), and results comparing free ARV access with OOPfees. Due to the heterogeneity in outcomes measurementacross publications, they were summarized and presented in tables, allowing for comparison of the diverse effect measures used (e.g., risk ratio, mean difference). In caseswhere information was missing or unclear, the authors were contacted for clarification. If no response was received, the missing data were documented as such. Synthesis method The results for the primary outcomes are presented in themain results section, as they align directly with the HIVcare and prevention cascades. Secondary outcomes (mor-tality and HIV transmission), which are less dependent on a single factor, such as free access to ARVs, are pre- sented in the supplemental material.

In instances of missing data in the main find- ing section of Tables 2and 3, the available information was utilized to perform calculations whenever feasible.The synthesis of each publication was guided by the struc- tured data extraction tool outlined in Section 2.5.D u et o the substantial heterogeneity among publications —such as variations in design and outcomes measurements —a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate. RESULTS Search and selection Our electronic search retrieved 34 164 publications. After removing 12 488 duplicates, 21 676 publications werescreened by title and abstract. Full-text screening was performed on 407 publications, of which 22 were retained for inclusion in our systematic review (Figure 1). The main reasons for exclusion were the absence of a compar- ison between free ARV access and OOP fees, and the lack of a report on one of our selected outcomes. Characteristics Nearly half of the final set of 22 publications originated from the Americas ( n=10) (Table 1)[25–34]. Half of the publications included ( n=11) were conducted in high- income countries (HICs) [ 25–31, 34 –37]. Most of the publi- cations focused on treatment for individuals living with HIV ( n=17) [25–29, 32, 33, 35, 38 –46], while the remain- ing publications focused on preventing HIV acquisitionamong people at risk ( n=5) [ 30, 31, 34, 36, 37 ]. Most of the designs were cohort ( n=10), quasi-experimental (n=4) or cross-sectional ( n=3). Many publications mea- sured the impact of free access to ARVs on being on ther- apy ( n=7), followed by being virally suppressed ( n=4) and being on PrEP ( n=2). Regarding the secondary out- comes, seven publications were identified on mortality and four publications on HIV infection (Table 2). Publications",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,9,"under study examined various free ARV access programmes. Half were from universal national/ s t a t ef r e eA R Vp o l i c i e s( n=11) and eight were from govern- ment-funded support programmes. The latter includes pro-grammes such as the AIDS Drug Assistance Program( A D A P ) ,w h i c hp r o v i d ef r e ea c c e s st oA R V sf o rp e o p l el i v i n g with HIV who lack sufficient financial resources in the United States. A minority focused on clinics and hospitalsoffering ARVs free of charge to their populations ( n=3). Most of the publications' study periods ended between 2018and 2024 ( n=9) and the median sample size was over 10 000 participants. The majority of the publications compared free ARVs to cost-sharing as a type of OOP fees ( n=18) and only one study compared free ARVs to paying the full cost of ARVs [ 42]. Most ( n=1 5 )r e p o r t e ds t a n d a r de r r o r (e.g., confidence intervals, standard deviation or standard error) alongside their result measures. Finally, data were obtained through surveys, interviews, hospital/clinic medicalrecords, national/state survei llance databases or insurance claims databases. HIV treatment outcomes As displayed in Table 2, 11 publications reported on the impact of free ARVs on HIV treatment outcomes. Seven publications focused on the second HIV care cascade target, that is, being on therapy, and four reported onthe third target, which is being virally suppressed. Many sub-populations, such as pregnant people living with HIV [ 41] and children living with HIV, were repre- sented [ 42]. As for being on therapy, the definition",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,10,"of the outcome varied greatly across publications, as demon- strated in Table 1. Inconsistent outcome definitions made it challenging to compare results across studies. Overall, free ART improved ARV use compared with OOP among people living with HIV. In one of the most robustly designed studies, Yi et al. [ 26]r e p o r t e dt h a t women living with HIV enrolled in ADAP were more than two times more likely to be on ART compared with women not enrolled (OR =2.35; 95% CI 1.49 –3.71). Moreover, in the most recent study identified (2023), Fennell et al. reported a significant increase of about 37% in the use of ART after the implementation of anational free ARV programme in pregnant people withHIV [ 41]. For the third target of the HIV care cascade, achieving viral suppression, this review i dentified four publications, all from HICs (see Table 2). Three cohorts from the United States assessed the impact of ADAP [ 27–29], while the remaining publication was an Australian study con-ducted before and after implementing a state policy to remove ART co-payment [ 35]. Two publications reported the probability of maintaining v irological suppression [ 27, 28 ] while the other two reported on the frequency of virological failure [ 29, 35 ]. All four studies showed that free ARV had a positive impact on viral suppression (see Table 2).

Furthermore, data were collected through a nationwide insurance claims database, meaningall types of populations using PrEP (men and transgenderwomen who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, etc.) were likely included. The first publica- tion, a cross-sectional study [ 30], analyzed PrEP discontin- uation and abandonment across various United States counties and the second, a cohort study [ 31], assessed how changes in OOP costs affected PrEP abandonment rates.Both studies found that higher OOP costs were associated with higher abandonment rates. Mortality and HIV infection Seven publications investigating the impact of free ARVs on mortality were identified (see Table S1). Most of the studies ( n=6) showed a reduction of mortality with free ART for both the adult/adolescent population ( n=6) as well as the paediatric population ( n=1) [32]. Five publi- cations focused on overall mortality, while two reportedAIDS-related deaths [ 32, 33 ]. All studies were from low/ middle-income countries (LMIC). For most ( n=5), the study period ended prior to 2005, before efforts to roll outART on a global scale. Braitstein et al. [ 39] evaluated 18 ART programmes across Africa, Asia and South America from the ART-LINC collaboration, a network of HIV/AIDS treatment programmes and cohorts. Theydemonstrated that free access to treatment in low-income settings reduced mortality rates by 75% (aHR =0.25; 95% CI 0.08 –0.78). Using data from the same international collaboration, Brinkhof et al. [ 40] also presented a signifi- cantly higher risk of mortality associated with OOPs pro- grammes (HR =4.64; 95% CI 1.11 –19.41). Two ecological studies from Mexico investigated the effects of the 2003 universal ARV governmental policy and reported decreased mortality rates after the new policy was imple-mented [ 32, 33 ]. Finally,",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,18,"three African publications found a positive association between initiation of free ART and mortality [ 38, 43, 45 ].

6,19,"blinded outcome assessment. Table S2shows the qual- ity assessment of all reviewed studies. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review toassess the impact of free ARV drugs on multiple aspects ofthe HIV cascade of care and on HIV prevention. It covered a wide range of literature, searching eight databases and sorting through no less than 34 000 publications, allowingfor the inclusion of diverse populations under differenthealthcare systems over two decades. It encompasses 22 publications, mostly observational studies, including seven on ARV use for the treatment of HIV, four on viralsuppression, seven on mortality, four on incident HIV infection and two on PrEP use. The provision of free ARV drugs was associated with a higher proportion of patients on ARV therapy and with viral suppression, with only one study showing con- verse outcomes [ 26]. This negative association can be explained by the fact that the Chinese National free ARV programme offers limited treatment options with more side effects than regimens offered to patients with privateinsurance. In the preventative context, free PrEP wasassociated with lower abandonment rates. Free ARV drugs were also associated with a decrease in HIV-related and all-cause mortality, as well as a reduction in incidentHIV infections. Although our literature review focused on selected outcomes, many others were found during the literaturereview. Many publications have also shown that provid- ing free access to ARVs, either for treatment [ 47–51]o r prevention [ 48], improves adherence. Better retention in care was also commonly reported as being a positiveimpact of free access to ARVs [ 15, 49, 52 –54]. The findings of this systematic review are consistent with those reported in a previo us review from 2005 focusing on developing countries where free ARVs improved viral suppression rates [ 55]. Our study also underscored the bene- fits of",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,20,"universal ART access in developed countries, withfindings aligning closely with a systematic review conducted by a non-profit organization [ 56]. This review similarly iden- tified a strong association between free ARV access andimprovements in both individual and population-level health outcomes. Like our review, it suggested that access to free ARV reduces HIV transmission, enhances viral suppres-sion rates and lowers mortality. Furthermore, the authorshighlighted the cost-effectiveness of offering free ARVs for people living with HIV. As for PrEP, several studies support its cost-effectiveness [ 57–60]. Although there is a lack of literature specifically reporting on the cost-effectiveness of offering PrEP for free, through a significant number ofqualitative studies in various key populations, many researchers were able to show that people at risk of HIVinfection are more inclined to take PrEP if it is free, suggest- i n gt h a tc o s ti sam a j o rb a r r i e rt oP r E Pu p t a k e[ 16, 61 –69]. Thus, if willingness to take PrEP increases when it is offeredfor free, this could be hypothesized to be associated with savings in healthcare costs. Our systematic review also has several limitations that should be kept in mind while interpreting the results. A systematic approach was followed to minimize biases, but many may persist due to the publications'methodology. It is conceivable that many biases willoccur when comparing people having access to free ARVs with people paying to obtain them. For example, the ADAP programme, featured in seven of our selected pub-lications, supports people living with HIV/AIDS who lack sufficient healthcare coverage or financial resources [ 25–29]. The programme eligibility criteria, such as meet- ing state-specific income limits (typically 200% –500% of the Federal Poverty Level) and being uninsured or under- insured, may have influenced outcomes",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,21,"as much as freeaccess to treatment. However, according to our review, free access through ADAP leads to better outcomes, a sign that free access to ARV might be able to mitigatepoor socio-economic status. Another significant source of bias was the study periods. Indeed, the clinical approaches to the treatment of HIV tend to vary over time. The efficacy and tolerabil-ity of ARVs have improved considerably over the years, leading to a possible overestimation of the benefits of free ARVs when pre/post designs were used. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has been crucial in expanding access to ARVs in LMIC, significantly enhancing HIV care by providingfree ARVs for millions since 2003 [ 70, 71 ]. However, no studies on PEPFAR were included in our review. This is because the support provided by PEPFAR made the dif- ference between ‘being unable to take ARVs ’and ‘ensur- ing that everyone receives ARV ’. Thus, studies reporting on the implementation of PEPFAR compared individuals with free access to ARVs with individuals most likely notreceiving ARVs at all. Despite the lack of studies included in our review, we believe decision-makers should recog- nize the programme's success as evidence that providingfree ARVs is both feasible and vital for addressing HIV. Further, in LMICs, fees can represent a significant bar- rier to access, whereas in HICs, they may pose only a minorconstraint, potentially amplifying the impact observed inLMIC studies. However, this ef fect is likely most relevant for the mortality outcome, which was only assessed in LMICs. For other outcomes, our review included numerousstudies conducted in HICs, where the benefits of free ART appeared equally favourable, s uggesting that the disparity1338 DOUTRE ET AL .",HIV-26-1329.pdf
6,22,"in cost barriers had minimal influence on our overall results. In addition, our analysis did not identify a consis-tent trend linking variations in ARV access policies to the type of healthcare system in place. While structural and systemic factors undoubtedly play a role, the diversity ofcountries from which our final selection of studies came suggests that differences in access are more strongly influ- enced by policy priorities and the degree to which publicauthorities prioritize healthcare and achieving interna- tional targets. Our findings also suggest that free ARV pro- grammes contribute directly to the principles of UHC byimproving access to life-saving treatment and reducingfinancial barriers. Our study is the first systematic review reporting evi- dence of the impact of free ARVs on various aspects ofHIV care and prevention continuums. The majority of the selected articles showed a positive impact on vari- ous aspects of the HIV care cascade and prevention con-tinuum when providing free ARV drugs. The diversity of the studies allows for a broad perspective, strengthening the generalizability of our findings across various con-texts and populations. The review focused on critical out- comes for decision-makers by examining how both HIV treatment and prevention cascade components demon-strate that free access to ARVs is essential to achievingWHO/UNAIDS 2030 targets and ending the HIV epi- demic. Although the variability among studies under- scores the need for further research, the overall benefitsof free ARV access suggest it could be a valuable strategy for nations still debating its implementation. Alternatives to free ARVs such as co-payments, co-insurance anddeductibles shift the financial burden from healthier, higher-income individuals to sicker, lower-income ones, putting vulnerable groups like people living with HIV at adisadvantage. While not the focus of this review, it is inter-esting for policymakers to consider other strategies such as ‘Lump-Sum Remuneration ’[ 72]—av o l u",HIV-26-1329.pdf

As we work towards global HIV targets, increasing ARV coverag e, particularly through free and accessible programmes, is crucial to ensure that morepeople use ARVs and achieve viral suppressions, which are key factors in both individual health outcomes and control the epidemic on a global scale.

To effectively prevent the development of CVDs in T2DM, consider ‑ able effort has been made to explore novel preventive approaches, individualized glycemic control and cardiovas‑ cular risk management (strict blood pressure and lipid control), together with recently developed glucose ‑lowering agents and lipid‑lowering drugs. This review mainly addresses the important issues affecting the choice of antidia‑ betic agents and lipid, blood pressure and antiplatelet treatments considering the cardiovascular status of the patient. Finally, we also discuss the changes in therapy principles underlying CVDs in T2DM.

Once mainly limited to older adults in the twentieth century, T2DM is now the largest global health crisis of the twenty-first century, and although its prevalence and incidence have shown the fastest increase in adults, T2DM is increasingly occurring in children and adolescents [1]. Premature mortality from diabe - tes increased by 5% during the period 2000–2016 [2]. Between 2000 and 2019, trends in deaths due to diabetes exhibited a 3% increase in age-standardized rates [3]. Of note, T2DM accounts for approximately 90% of all diabe - tes cases, and cardiovascular (CV) events in people with T2DM are a major cause of the increased risk of early death and have become a rising threat to human health worldwide. The major CV diseases (CVDs) associated with T2DM include ischemic heart disease, heart failure (HF), stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral artery dis - ease, and these complications can result in death for at least 50% of patients with T2DM [4]. Therefore, CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prog - nosis of T2DM. T2DM is characterized by insulin resist - ance and hyperglycemia, which is usually, but not always, accompanied by abnormal lipid metabolism. Insulin resistance generally occurs early in the progression of T2DM and CVD [5]. Importantly, insulin resistance is associated with a higher relative risk of CV events [6].

Moreo - ver, hypoglycemia, which has generally been recognized as an adverse effect of glucose reduction, has also been reported as a risk factor for CVD among patients with T2DM [9]. Overall, CVD associated with diabetes is a major cause of death and disability among patients with T2DM. To date, limited progress has been made in the pre - vention of T2DM, and no country or health care sys - tem is immune to the threat of T2DM. Although the incidence and mortality rate of CVD have decreased in high-income countries, these countries account for only approximately 10% of the world population, and CVD incidence and mortality trends in T2DM patients in mid - dle- and low-income countries remains unclear [10]. In addition, considering the clinical burden of CVD com - plications in T2DM patients, attention to the joint man - agement of T2DM and CVD has been increasing. In this review, we focus more thoroughly on the current state of the epidemiology of CVD in T2DM and on preventive measures and then explore measures to reduce the threat from CVD in T2DM patients. Current trends in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in T2DM While globally the incidence of CVD among patients with T2DM is 2–3 times higher than among those without T2DM, data suggest a decreasing trend worldwide in the overall prevalence of CVD attributed to T2DM. The cur - rently available data are shown in Table 1. Before 2016, the prevalence of all CVDs in T2DM ranged from 14.3 to 46.9%[11], while a meta-analysis for the years 2007– 2017 indicated a prevalence of 32%[4]. The weighted CVD prevalence in 2019 was reported to be 34.8% across 13 countries, although there was",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,5,"a wide range between countries from 18.0% in Saudi Arabia to 56.5% in Israel. [12]. There was a general trend of reduced incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and HF, and peripheral artery disease [12]. The study by Artime et.al demonstrated that the prevalence of CVD among patients with T2DM in Spain was ranged from 7 to 41%, and in-hospital mortality rates due to CVD were between 6 and 11%[13]. The reduction in the incidence of CVD in T2DM is consistent with new findings from Ethiopia [14], Sweden [15], and South Korea [16]. However, in the study from South Korea the risk of HF increased over the years 2006 to 2015 [16], and this finding was also observed among patients with a T2DM duration over 10 years and among those with a history of hypertension [17]. The occurrence of HF has been found to be related to diabetes duration, with a 17% increase in HF risk strongly associated with each 5-year increase in diabetes duration [18]. The decreasing incidence of CVD among T2DM patients has been reported in high-income countries, such as Sweden, the USA, Canada, and the United King - dom, with a 3–5% yearly decline in the rates of CVD since the early 1990s [19]. However, a large gap remains in the incidence of CV morbidity and mortality between people with T2DM and those without the disease. Unfor - tunately, there is a paucity of data on CVD incidence among people with T2DM from middle- and low-income countries and in global investigations. Consistent with the declining trend of CVD inci - dence, the incidence of death from CVD in T2DM stead - ily dropped in 2019 [3]. There was approximately a 20% reduction in the mortality rates in Sweden from 1998 through 2014 [15]. Additionally, a",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,6,"general trend toward a reduction in T2DM mortality was reported in countries from the European Union between 1990 and 2019 [20]. Likewise, reductions in the death rate and the proportion of deaths from vascular causes decreased from 1988–94 to 2010–15 in the USA [21]. A similar trend was also observed in Hong Kong [22] and South Korea [16]. How - ever, in contrast to the findings of observational studies, a systematic review of diabetes CV outcome clinical trials reported no improvement in CV mortality in T2DM; the possible cause underlying the difference between rand - omized controlled trials (RCTs) and real world data may be the lack of standardized definitions of CVD outcomes (including HF) [23]. The overall estimated CVD mortality rates among patients with diabetes are higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries [24]. Thus, the global CVD-related mortality among peo - ple with diabetes in low-income countries may decrease in time, in-line with high-income countries. Despite the trend in the reduction in the overall CVD mortality, the incidence and mortality rate of T2DM continue to increase annually, and along with popula - tion growth and aging, the total number of CVD- and T2DM-related deaths have increased worldwide [3]. The highest number of deaths due to diabetes in adults in 2019 occurred in the Western Pacific region, followed by Table 1 Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in T2DM CVD cardiovascular diseaseOutcome Before 2016 [11] 2007–2017 [4] 2019 [12] All CVDs 14.3–46.9% 32% 34.8% Coronary artery disease 1.8–25.6% 21% 10.9% Heart attack 3.3–17.8% 10% 4.6% Stroke 1.7–17.7% 7.6% 5% Heart failure 14.9% 2.4% Peripheral artery disease2.6%",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,7,"Southeast Asia, and the highest proportion of deaths due to diabetes among patients under the age of 60 in 2019 was in Africa [24]. CVD and diabetes were among the top ten causes of death globally in 2019 and are a consider - able threat to human health. A transition in the major cause of death in T2DM from CVD to non-CVD was observed in the ALTITUDE trial [25]. Non-vascular, non-cancer causes of death among American adults diagnosed with diabetes accounted for approximately 46.5% of all deaths during 2010–2015, and the proportion of cancer-related deaths did not change from 1988 to 2015 [21]. A change in the leading cause of death from vascular causes to cancer among people with diabetes was observed in England from 2001 to 2018 [26]. In addition, a decrease in mortality due to cancer and CVD in older people with T2DM in Australia was observed, masking the rising excess risk among patients of younger ages [27]. There is a suggestion that younger- onset T2DM may be associated with an increase in CVD- related mortality but a slight decrease in cancer-related mortality [28]. In summary, notwithstanding some reductions in CVD mortality in T2DM, there is a paucity of data about the leading cause of death among T2DM patients, especially at younger ages. Prevention of cardiovascular disease in T2DM A focus on efforts to prevent CVD events in high-risk populations might reduce mortality and decrease the economic burden of heart attack and stroke. CVD can be prevented or delayed by controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol and with lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking, eating healthily, and increasing physical activity. Primary prevention involves preventing or delaying new-onset CVD in patients with T2DM.

7,8,"of T2DM in subjects without CVD are needed. Secondary prevention involves treatment of risk factors in diabetic patients with established CVD. Comprehensive medical intervention for secondary prevention among diabetic patients with clinical CVD was approved by the American Heart Asso - ciation (AHA) in 1999 [29]; a position statement by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in 2012 outlined the need for individualized glycemic targets and glucose-lowering therapies in combination with compre - hensive CV risk reduction, indicating that patient-cen - tered care must be a consideration in decision-making for secondary prevention among T2DM patients with established CVD [30]. Beginning in 2018, the glucocen - tric strategy for the management of CVD in T2DM tran - sitioned to patient-centered care [31], and individual medical history, lifestyle behaviors, and CV and meta - bolic risk factors were included as considerations. Pre - cision medical therapeutic approaches for patients with T2DM with CVD will be gradually achieved [32]. CVD risk assessment aims to provide appropriate regimens for the prevention and treatment of CVD in T2DM. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and AHA have developed a risk stratification tool for primary prevention in patients with T2DM; the Risk Estimator Plus tool can be used to calculate ten-year atherosclerosis CVD risk and provide individualized advice for patients aged 40–79 years. Risk stratification for secondary pre - vention is under clinical testing [33]. Alternatively, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends that CVD risk stratification be divided into moderate-, high-, and very high-risk levels for patients with either pre-DM or established DM based on comorbidities and the dura - tion of the disease, rather than into primary or secondary prevention groups. These three levels of risk stratifica - tion support individualized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,9,"to patient care in diabetes [34]. The ACC/AHA and ESC methods differ somewhat in the criteria they use for risk stratification. The Risk Esti - mator Plus does not account for the comorbidities and duration of diabetes, especially for adolescents due to the increase in obesity incidence, but it does consider age ≥ 40 years, sex, blood pressure, blood lipids, history of diabetes, smoking and drug use. Risk stratification for secondary prevention accounts for age ≥ 75 years, DM, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, previous stroke, previous coronary artery bypass graft, history of HF, active smoking, and renal dysfunction. The ESC method based on three levels of risk stratification recognizes the complexity of developing CVD by considering comorbid - ities and the duration of diabetes, and also accounts for obesity, renal impairment, left ventricular hypertrophy, and retinopathy rather than a history of CV-related dis - ease. A comparison of the benefits of the risk estimator and that of risk stratification would be useful to obtain a consensus to facilitate the choice of individualized care in patients with T2DM and CVD. Individualized glycemic management in patients with T2DM and CVD A meta-analysis of 102 prospective studies showed that fasting blood glucose concentrations ≥ 7 mmol/L conferred an elevated risk of coronary heart disease [35]. Additionally, impaired glucose tolerance and elevated HbA1c (> 5.7%) levels have been associated with an increased risk of CVD [36]. An increased blood glucose concentration in the general popula - tion or in patients with atherosclerotic CVD con - fers an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CVD",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,10,"Page 4 of 15 Ma et al. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022) 21:74 [37]. Individualized glycemic management may lead to improved prevention of CVD in T2DM. In this sec - tion, we focus on current aspects of individualized management of T2DM. Glycemic targets With respect to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) targets, the AHA, ADA, ESC and ESC/EASD guidelines propose a target of < 7%, and gives further recommendations for less stringent targets in older or more frail adults. A tar - get of ≤ 6.5% for those with an early diagnosis, who are not frail, and who do not have established atheroscle - rotic CVD. This is consistent with current ESC, ADA and AHA guidelines on DM and CVD [38–41](Table 2). Achieving a glycemic target of an HbA1c level < 7% for patients with T2DM reduces the incidence of the development of microvascular complications and CVD. A more stringent HbA1c goal (< 6.5%) is defined for selected children and adolescents, those with a short duration of DM, lesser degrees of β-cell dysfunction and no evidence of CVD. An HbA1c target of < 6% may be optimal during pregnancy without significant hypogly - cemia. Furthermore, a less stringent HbA1c goal (< 8.0% or even slightly higher) may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy, a history of advanced micro - vascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing T2DM [38]. The association of HF mortality with HbA1c goals in T2DM has a “U” shape, where a modest HbA1c level of 7.1–8.0% is associated with the lowest mortality among patients with HF and T2DM [42], whereas an HbA1c level < 6.0% or > 8%, and even > 10%, may increase the risk of incident HF or HF-related hospitalization [43].Antidiabetic treatment choice The novel glucose-lowering agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,11,"agonists, have been shown to lower athero - sclerotic CVD and HF risks independently of baseline HbA1c[44]; this has led to newer treatment approach. A reasonable regimen of glycemic control is associated with both glycemic targets and strategies of glucose-lowering therapy, and the medical provider must prioritize the patient’s CV state based on preference and the prescrip - tion history. Metformin The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 34) found that metformin therapy reduced all-cause mortality by 36% and heart attack incidence by 39% among over - weight patients with newly diagnosed T2DM [45]. More - over, a continued benefit of reductions in microvascular risk, myocardial infarction and death over 10 years after metformin therapy in that trial were reported [46]. Met - formin administration may be the primary preventive measure against the risk of CVD among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM without established CVD. How - ever, there is insufficient evidence for the use of met - formin for secondary prevention in patients with T2DM and established CVD [47]. Only one RCT that included 68 patients with CAD showed a cardioprotective role of metformin [48], and in another trial, 36 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) showed increased myocardial efficiency after metformin treatment [49]. Nonetheless, the additional benefits of metformin may include prevention of the occurrence of new T2DM and cancer [50, 51], weight gain and hypoglycemia, and pro - longed gestation in preterm preeclampsia [52].

7,13,"metformin administration is suitable for the treatment of patients with T2DM without established CVD as well as those with CVD. Sodium‑glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors A meta-analysis of three studies showed that sodium-glu - cose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced major adverse CV events by 11% in patients with T2DM and atherosclerotic CVD and reduced the risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF by 23% and the risk of renal disease progression by 45% among patients with T2DM [53]. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter progres - sion [54, 55]. Currently, the approved SGLT2 inhibitors are empa - gliflozin [56], canagliflozin [57], dapagliflozin [58], ertugliflozin [59], tofogliflozin [60], luseogliflozin [61] and ipragliflozin [61] (Table 3). The available studies focused on CVD are mainly limited to the United States and Europe; however, more recent real-world data have also shown a reduced risk of CV events across a wide range of patient characteristics from 6 countries in the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East, and North Ameri - can regions [61]. In HF, empagliflozin administration was associated with improved clinical outcomes for the HFrEF phenotype [62], and the overall risk of HF events between HFrEF and HFpEF was reduced by canagliflozin [63], dapagliflozin [64], and ertugliflozin [65]. Overall, data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors have mod - erate benefits in CVD and robust benefits in HF and renal disease and should be considered for primary and secondary prevention of CVD and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM, regardless of existing atheroscle - rotic CVD or a history of HF [53]. A recent meta-analysis by Giugliano et al. provided an update of all large CV outcome trials (CVOTs) with SGLT-2 inhibitors, with findings indicating that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM resulted in a sustained",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,14,"to moder - ate reduction of the composite CV death or hospitaliza - tion for HF, robust reduction of HF, moderate reduction of CV mortality, total mortality and major adverse car - diac events (MACE) [66]. Furthermore, a comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs provided direct evidence for the absolute benefits and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [67]. Importantly, this com - prehensive systematic review found that SGLT-2 inhibi - tors reduced all cause and CV mortality, myocardial infarction, admission for heart failure and kidney failure, without a reduction in non-fatal stroke. In addition to the role of individual SGLT2 inhibitors, inhibitors of both SGLT1 and SGLT2 (dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors) have the ability to reduce intestinal glucose absorption after meals since SGLT1 in the small intes - tine [68]. Sotagliflozin, the first dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor, approved for T1DM and T2DM in the EU and T2DM in the US, has exhibited CV benefits in patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease [69]; a similar result was shown in patients with T2DM and HFrEF or HFpEF [70]. The adverse events of sotagliflozin include diar - rhea, genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Dual inhibition of SGLT1/2 with licogliflozin treatment showed CV benefits in patients with T2DM and HF, and licogliflozin has a greater effect than empagliflozin on glucose lowering, weight loss, and systolic blood pressure reduction [71]. The CV benefits of sotagliflozin seem to be equal to those of SGLT2 inhibi - tors. Sotagliflozin and licogliflozin may be recommended as first-line therapies among patients with T2DM, regardless of the presence of atherosclerotic CVD or a history of HF. Other trials of SGLT1/2 inhibitors, including LX4211 [72], LX-2761, and YG-1699, for treating CVD in patients with T2DM are underway. Glucagon‑like",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,15,"peptide‑1 receptor agonists Five CVOTs, namely, LEADER3, SUSTAIN-6, REWIND, HARMONY, and AMPLITUDE-O [73] have consist - ently shown the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 agonists in patients with T2DM and have provided evidence of a secondary preventive effect of GLP-1 agonists in T2DM patients with CVD and kidney disease. Nevertheless, the ELIXA and EXSCEL trials did not show any benefit on CVD or kidney outcomes (Table 4). Currently, a nota - ble decrease in CVD outcomes has been observed with several GLP-1 agonists; furthermore, GLP-1 agonists promote a reduction in CV risk factors, and dulaglutide showed strong evidence of primary prevention. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced MACE Table 3 Cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors – limited data, MACE major adverse cardiac event, HR hazard ratio, CV cardiovascular, HF heart failureAgents MACEs (HR) CV death (HR) HF (HR) Renal outcome (HR) Empagliflozin [56] 0.86 0.62 0.65 0.5 Canagliflozin [57] 0.86 0.87 0.67 0.6 Dapagliflozin [58] 0.93 0.98 0.73 0.76 Ertugliflozin [59] 0.97 0.92 0.7 0.81 Tofogliflozin [60] – – – – Luseogliflozin [61] – – – – Ipragliflozin [61] – – – –",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf

Another meta-analysis showed that GLP-1 receptor agonists are efficacious for treating obesity and T2DM in children [74]. GLP-1 receptor agonists also safely reduce total MACEs by 12%, hospital admission for HF by 9%, and composite kidney outcomes (reduction in uri - nary albumin excretion) by 17% in adult T2DM patients [75]. Unexpectedly, a beneficial effect on HF has been observed with GLP-1 agonists. Furthermore, the largest and most current systematic review showed that GLP-1 agonists reduced all cause and CV mortality, myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, kidney failure and admis - sion for HF in subjects with T2DM [67]. Overall, these important data provide novel insights into the benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists in CVD patients; however, the benefits they may confer to primary prevention patients are unclear. In summary, GLP-1 agonists show a beneficial effect on CVD, HF, and kidney outcomes and a reduction in weight gain, blood pressure, and levels of HbA1c and LDL-C. Therefore, GLP-1 agonists are recommended in the context of secondary prevention in patients with T2DM and CVD. Finally, because the dual GIP/GLP-1 agonists will soon be introduced into clinical practice, it is worth address - ing their potential. A phase 3 trial of tirzepatide showed that the mean HbA1c level decreased from baseline by 1.87–2.07%, more participants met their HbA1c targets, and weight loss ranged from 7.0 to 9.5 kg [76].

7,17,"dulaglutide [77] and semaglutide [78]. Unfortunately, there are still no data on CVOTs with tirzepatide. How - ever, tirzepatide treatment showed a good safety profile in T2DM patients with a high risk of or established CVD, an improved effect on HbA1c in comparison with insu - lin glargine, and no increases in MACE events compared to insulin glargine [79]. Available data show an impor - tant effect of tirzepatide in terms of HbA1c reduction, weight loss, blood pressure and lipid profiles, with this effect persisting for up to 2 years without increased CVD risk [ 80]. Tirzepatide displays primary preventive effects in T2DM with or without CVD risk and may be a well- positioned glucose-lowering agent in future therapeutic regimens. Clinical trials of dual GIP/GLP-1 agonists, such as combined GIP and GLP-1 infusion [81] and NNC0090- 2746 [82], are ongoing. Other antidiabetic agents Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors have been reported to be neutral with regard to CV outcomes [83]. However, the use of saxagliptin is associated with an increase in hospitalization for HF [84], which should be carefully considered. Regarding sulfonylureas, these older agents are inex - pensive and widely available and are used as glucose-low - ering agents for T2DM patients with CVD. The UKPDS 33 has confirmed the reduced microvascular risk of sulfo - nylureas [85]. In addition, the TOSCA.IT trial confirmed the CV safety of sulfonylureas [86]. Insulin is a widely extended therapeutic option. A meta-analysis showed that insulin treatment does not increase the risk of CV mortality and myocardial infarction [87]. A RCT showed that insulin glargine had a neutral effect on CV outcomes [88], and insulin is widely used to treat T2DM with CVD. Finally, pioglitazone reduced key secondary macrovas - cular outcomes in people with T2DM without CV events whose glucose levels were controlled with",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf

Although the PROactive trial failed to show an effect of pioglitazone on the primary compos - ite outcome, this drug resulted in a decrease in the sec - ondary outcome (i.e., the classical 3 component MACE) [89]. Pioglitazone was also associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction in patients without diabetes [90].

7,19,"pioglitazone should not be used to treat subjects with HF. Therefore, pioglitazone may be used as an add-on treat - ment to metformin for people with T2DM, as these drugs are widely available and affordable. Current recommendations on the use of antidiabetic drugs with regard to CVD Different scientific societies recommend the use of anti - diabetic therapies in CVD, including the AHA [39], the ADA [ 91], the ESC [41] and the ESC/EASD [40]; Chi - nese scientific bodies, however, do not [92]. The overall medication regimen is roughly similar, with a key focus on metformin, GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors in guidelines for treating CVD in T2DM patients (Table 5). The ADA and the EASD issued an update of their joint 2018 recommendations on management of hyperglyce - mia [93]. The major updates included: 1) SGLT2 inhibi - tors are recommended in patients with T2DM and HF, particularly those with HFrEF, to reduce hHF, MACE, and CV death and to prevent the progression of CKD, HF, MACE, and CV death in patients with T2DM with CKD; 2) to reduce risk of MACE, GLP-1 receptor ago - nists can also be considered in patients with type 2 diabe - tes without established CVD with indicators of high risk, specifically, patients aged 55 years or older with coronary, carotid, or lower extremity artery stenosis > 50%, and left ventricular hypertrophy. 3) for patients with type 2 dia - betes and established atherosclerotic CV disease (such as those with prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina with ECG changes, myocardial ischemia on imaging or stress test, or revascularization of coro - nary, carotid, or peripheral arteries) where MACE is the gravest threat, the level of evidence for MACE benefit is greatest for GLP-1 receptor agonists.The use of glucose-lowering agents should depend",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,20,"on CV status and T2DM complications. SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) are asso - ciated with a lower risk of HF hospitalization in patients with DM, and are recommended [94]. More importantly, the largest available systematic review found that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists lowered all-cause mortality, CV mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and kidney failure. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced admission to hospital for HF more than GLP-1 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced non-fatal stroke more than SGLT-2 inhibitors (which appeared to have no effect) [67]. One RCT has shown the efficacy of metformin in patients with T2DM and HF [48]. Accordingly, met - formin should be considered for treating patients with T2DM and HF (eGFR > 30 mL/min) [94]. Pioglitazone and saxagliptin are contraindicated in patients with HF or at risk of HF. Although initial data from RCTs of GLP-1 agonists supported a neutral effect on the risk of HF, a recent meta-analysis showed benefits of GLP-1 ago - nists in HF and diabetes [67]. However, current guide - lines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors as the most suitable treatment in patients with HF. Hypertension The presence of hypertension in patients with T2DM significantly increases the risk of CVD development, and a study revealed that evaluated blood pressure down to < 120 mm Hg and < 70 mm Hg could decrease mortal - ity, macrovascular, and microvascular events regardless of baseline systolic blood pressure [39]. Thus, lowering blood pressure reduces CVD events and microvascular Table 5 Recommendations on the use of antidiabetic drugs DM diabetes mellitus, CVD cardiovascular disease, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus, ASCVD atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ADA American Diabetes Association, ESC European Society of Cardiology, EASD European Association for the Study of Diabetes, HF heart failure, SGLT-2 sodium-glucose cotransporter -2, GLP-1 RA glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist,",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf

Blood pressure treatment target A target of 140/90 mmHg may be reasonable among patients with T2DM and stable CAD or patients with higher blood pressure targets; lower blood pressure targets of < 130/80 mmHg can be recommended for patients with a higher risk of stroke and microvascu - lar complications, according to the AHA [95]. A target of < 130/80 mmHg may be appropriate for patients with diabetes and hypertension at higher CV risk (exist - ing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 15%), whereas a blood pressure target of < 140/90 mmHg is recommended for individu - als with diabetes and hypertension at lower risk for CVD (10-year ASCVD risk < 15%). The ADA advises that a reading higher than 120/80 mmHg in patients with T2DM indicates the need for lifestyle intervention. In pregnant patients with diabetes and preexisting hyper - tension, a blood pressure target of 110–135/85 mmHg is suggested in the interest of reducing the risk for accelerated maternal hypertension [91]. ESC guide - lines recommend that the initial target of < 140/90 mm Hg with goal of 120–130/ < 80 mm Hg is suitable for patients aged 18–69; the target of 130–139/ < 80 mm Hg, with < 130/ < 80 mm Hg being acceptable if toler - ated is suitable for adults ≥ 70 years of age [41], although the blood pressure target for T2DM patients with CVD is unclear. Overall, individualized blood pressure targets are recommended based on CVD status and individual condition (Table 6).

7,23,"classes demonstrated to reduce CVD events in patients with T2DM and hypertension, and dual therapy, ACE inhibitors or ARBs in conjunction with dihydropyri - dine calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuret - ics are recommended as the first-line treatment[41, 94]. For patients with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g, initial treatment should include an ACE inhibitor or ARB. For patients with pre-DM, ACE inhib - itors or ARBs rather than diuretics or β-blockers are recommended due to the increased risk of new-onset T2DM from diuretics and β-blockers [96]. Nebivolol does not reduce insulin sensitivity and may be used as an antihypertensive treatment for T2DM patients [97]. In addition, a double-blind clinical trial has shown that the non-steroidal potent MRA blocker finer - enone is efficacious and safe to reduce HF cardiac biomarkers, HF, and albuminuria in T2DM. Differ - ent trials also demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary outcome (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF) in those subjects with T2DM and chronic kidney dis - ease receiving finerenone [98– 100].

7,25,"significantly improved cardiorenal outcomes in patients with T2DM and kidney disease irrespective of HbA1c levels or insulin use [101]. Therefore, finerenone should be considered for treatment of patients with T2DM, and this agent is likely to be included as an impor - tant treatment option in future updates of current guidelines. Lipid management The presence of diabetic dyslipidemia in patients with T2DM is, at least in part, a cause of CVD. Moreover, diabetic dyslipidemia, including elevated triglycer - ides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is associated with increased CV events, especially in high-risk populations [102]. Accounting for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification is necessary for patients with T2DM [103]. Lipid targets The concept of “lower is better” regarding LDL levels has been supported for reducing the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM and CVD [104]. The ADA guidelines recom - mend that lifestyle interventions be initiated for indi - viduals with abnormal triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL) and/or HDL-C levels (< 40 mg/dL for men, 50 mg/dL for women), and an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% or more from baseline is reasonable for patients with dia - betes and 10-year ASCVD risk of 20% or higher [91]. The ESC/EASD guidelines recommend an LDL-C target of < 55 mg/dL for those with T2DM and at very high CV risk [ 94]. The AHA guidelines recommend an LDL-C tar - get reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline for those with dia - betes and clinical CVD [39]. The ESC established goals for LDL-C based on level of ASCVD risk [41]. With respect to lipid targets, the AHA/ADA and the ESC/ EASD guideline are shown in Table 7.Treatment choice Meta-analysis has shown that statins are the most effective therapy for reducing CV mortality, followed by",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,26,"PCSK9 inhibitors and statins in combination with ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitors effectively reduce MACEs [105], and statin therapy and add-on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe exhibit significant ben - efit in CVD outcomes [106]. Fibrate therapy reduces major CVD events [107], and icosapent ethyl exerts a risk reduction in CVD outcomes beyond lipid-lowering effects [108]. Overall, these lipid-lowering drugs have CV benefits for secondary prevention. Depending on the baseline LDL-C levels, the ini - tiation of statin therapy remains the first-line treat - ment in patients (aged < 50 years) with a T2DM duration < 10 years and without CVD risk factors or with an LDL-C of > 100 mg/dL. In patients at very high CVD risk, if the LDL-C target is not reached, despite treatment with the maximum tolerated statin dose, combination therapy with ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor is recom - mended [41, 94]. In high- and very high-risk patients with triglycerides of 200–500 mg/dL, statins combined with a fibrate or icosapent ethyl may be considered for both macro- and microvascular benefits in patients with T2DM [109]. Statin therapy is contraindicated in patients with pregnancy. Antiplatelet therapy T2DM is associated with increased blood thrombo - genicity among patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [110]. Platelet P2Y12 expression is increased fourfold in patients with T2DM, and plate - let activation and hypercoagulation in T2DM induce a prothrombotic state and result in an increased risk for CVD events [111].

7,28,"Page 10 of 15 Ma et al. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022) 21:74 Aspirin The use of aspirin decreases the risk of T2DM among healthy men but not among women [112]. Low-dose aspirin (81 or 100 mg) is neutral for CVD outcomes and increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding when used for primary prevention among patients with T2DM [113]. Contemporary meta-analyses show that the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CV events needs to be reconsidered [114, 115] due to inconsistent CVD ben - efits and an increased bleeding risk. In secondary prevention trials, meta-analyses showed that medium-dose aspirin (75–325 mg/day) reduces vascular events over 2 years [116], an aspirin dose of 75–150 mg daily is a protective regimen for patients with occlusive vascular events [117], and aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of CVD has long been estab - lished [118]. Nonetheless, the longest duration of the included trials was just 4 years, and the aspirin effect for longer term use this requires caution, particularly in the post-acute setting [119]. Meta-analyses showed that early aspirin discontinuation in patients with acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary inter - vention (PCI) prevented bleeding events with a neutral effect on CVD outcomes [120], and the duration of aspi - rin use (3 months) in patients undergoing complex PCI reduced the risk of bleeding without increasing the risk of ischemic events [121]. In acute settings, reducing the duration of aspirin use (< 3 months) for secondary pre - vention of CVD may be proposed. P2Y12 inhibitors Compared with aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in secondary pre - vention [122]; thus, P2Y12 inhibitors may be a useful option for secondary prevention. P2Y12 inhibitors include prasugrel, ticagrelor and clopidogrel. Long-term admin - istration of clopidogrel reduces the risk of",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,29,"myocardial infarction or vascular death, and the overall efficacy is superior to that of aspirin [123]. The benefits of prasug - rel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel are even greater, and a reduction in CVD mortality was observed only with ticagrelor [124]. Ticagrelor exerts similar or greater inhi - bition of platelet reactivity than prasugrel in diabetic patients with CAD [125]. For patients after PCI, discon - tinuation of aspirin within 1 to 3 months with contin - ued P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy has a neutral effect on MACE outcomes with a reduction in bleeding [121]. Rivaroxaban Rivaroxaban has been shown to reduce the incidence of CVD and an increased risk of bleeding among patients with chronic coronary syndrome [126]. Compared to warfarin, rivaroxaban reduces stroke, myocardial infarction and MACEs with a lower risk of bleeding among patients with atrial fibrillation and diabetes [127]. Treatment choice Depending on risk stratification and the risk of bleeding, ESC guidelines recommend that aspirin be considered for primary prevention among patients with a risk of CVD or a diagnosis of CVD and low risk of bleeding [41, 94]. Intensive secondary prevention is indicated for patients with T2DM and CVD. Aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) is recommended as a secondary preventive strategy for patients with T2DM and atherosclerotic CVD. For dia - betic patients with an aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/ day) should be used [128]. Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy is approved for patients with additional high-risk markers. The addition of clopidogrel to aspirin for people with CVD risk or established CVD is associated with a reduc - tion in myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, how - ever it also leads to an increase in bleeding [129]. This regimen may increase CVD death among patients with DM and microalbuminuria (≥ 30 μg/mL) [130]. The CV benefit of clopidogrel",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,30,"plus aspirin is reduced in T2DM due to high platelet reactivity, and increasing the dose of clopidogrel and aspirin may enhance antiplatelet effects [131, 132]. The benefit of an intensive antiplatelet regi - men in these patients is still unclear. The National Insti - tute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends prasugrel plus aspirin for people with ST elevation myo - cardial infarction after PCI. Prasugrel or ticagrelor plus aspirin is recommended for people with non-ST eleva - tion myocardial infarction after PCI. Clopidogrel and oral anticoagulants other than prasugrel or ticagrelor for up to one year are recommended for people with acute coro - nary syndrome and atrial fibrillation after PCI [133]. The recommended duration of these regimens is > 30 months [134], while meta-analyses have indicated inconsistent results on the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI with drug-eluting stents [135, 136], and discontinua - tion of aspirin within 1 to 3 months with continued P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy is recommended [137]. For patients with DM and atrial fibrillation or periph - eral artery disease, ESC guidelines recommend rivar - oxaban therapy [94]. Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is the preferred long-term antithrombotic regimen for patients with chronic coronary syndrome and high-risk factors [126]. Conclusion The current main targets for the control of glycemia, lipids and blood pressure levels in patients according to the most commonly used guidelines should be included as an individualized strategy to prevent CVD in T2DM",s12933-022-01516-6.pdf
7,31,"(Tables 2, 6 and 7). Although the incidence and mortal - ity rate of T2DM-related CVD have decreased, the preva - lence and mortality rate of CVDs in patients with T2DM continues to rise, and most T2DM-related CVDs may be prevented by lifestyle modification and the use of adjunc - tive drugs. The notion of T2DM-related CVD care has transitioned from comprehensive medical intervention to precision diabetes therapy. For T2DM patients with established CVD, the GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and blood-pressure and lipid-lowering drugs provide an improved precision treatment approach.

Despite genetic progress in milk production, the average herd life has declined in many high -yielding dairy systems, raising concerns about early c ulling. This study analyzed data from 2057 Holstein –Friesian cows in Hungary to characterize the distribution and timing of culling events and to identify major risk factors affecting pro- ductive lifespan. We studied age, parity, milk yield, and culling rea son using descriptive statistics, Kruskal –Wallis tests, multinomial logistic regression, and Kaplan –Meier sur- vival analysis. Udder health problems were found to be the most frequent cause of culling (22.8%), followed by metabolic disorders (18.2%), locomot ive problems (17.3%), and re- productive disorders (17.1%). Economic reasons such as low milk production contributed to a smaller proportion of culling. Most cows were culled after the second or third lacta- tion, with survival probability dropping sharply wit hin the first 1500 –2000 days of life. Cows reaching four or more lactations represented a small but economically and genet- ically valuable subset of the herd. Our results indicated that in Hungary culling decisions are largely determined by health problems, which represent a greater limitation to the productive",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,2,"potential of dairy cows than economic factors. This research recommends that breeding programs prioritize genetic selection for robustness and that herd management adopts preventive health and reprodu ctive strategies to prolong cow longevity, ulti- mately enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of dairy production systems. Addition- ally, prevention of animal wastage to foster animal welfare could be suggested as an ad- ditional advantage.

8,3,"often reflect underlying health disorders, and improving longevity therefore contributes directly to better welfare outcomes [5,6]. Economically, it is well established that cows generally become profitable only after their second or third lactation, so pr emature culling prevents farms from recouping their initial investments [1,2,7]. Similar observations were reported by ref. [8] in Romanian Black and White cows, where herds with a longer pro- ductive lifespan, averaging nearly nine years, achieved significa ntly higher milk yield ef- ficiency per day of life. Their findings emphasized that extended longevity substantially improves the economic return of dairy operations under Central and Eastern European production conditions. The aforementioned facts reveal th at functional longevity has be- come a central target of both genetic selection and management strategies designed to enhance resilience and lifetime productivity [2,3,9]. Nevertheless, despite these benefits, productive lifetime in high -yielding dairy sys- tems remains relatively short and shows a declining trend in several regions worldwide. In many high -yielding dairy systems, herd life is limited to three lactations, with annual culling rates of 25 –40% [1,6,10]. Involuntary culling is mainly driven by health and fertility problems, which far outweigh voluntary removals based on production, with mastitis, reproductive failure, lameness, and metabolic disorders identified as the main factors [2,11,12]. These risks are not uniformly distributed across age groups: younger cows are more likely to be culled early due to reproductive inefficiency and locomotor disorders, while metabolic and chronic health problems tend to accumulat e with age, ultimately re- ducing the productive lifespan of older animals [2,10]. In Hungary, similar culling patterns were detected. On average, Holstein –Friesian cows are culled after only 2.2 completed lactations and nearly one -third are removed from the herd during their first lactation [13,14]. Early culling prevents many cows from reach- ing their peak productive",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,4,"stage in the third lactation, thereby reducing overall farm effi- ciency and profitability. Health -related problems are the predominant reasons for culling, with low milk yield, reproductive disorders, and udder health problem s together account- ing for over two -thirds of all cases [13,14]. Chronic mastitis alone has been responsible for about 30% of all cullings in some herds, highlighting the importance of udder health prob- lems [13]. A high proportion of first -lactation cows ex perience health problems within the first months after calving, and nearly half of the animals culled during their first parity are removed as a consequence of fertility -related problems [14]. These findings emphasize the critical need to improve reproduct ive efficiency and udder health management if lon- gevity is to be extended. Technological and management factors also shape longevity outcomes. Stress caused by human handling or unfamiliar milking procedures has been shown to negatively affect milk let-down and yield, indirectly contributing to vulnerability and culling risk [15] . In contrast, modernization of milking technologies may provide solutions. Recent Hungar- ian studies proved that robotic milking systems not only increase milk yield but also sig- nificantly reduce somatic cell counts compared to conventional parlors, thus improving both productivity and udder health [16]. Such evidence suggests that investments in tech- nology, alongside targeted herd health programs, could help mitigate the leading causes of early culling. Overall, the Hungarian dairy sector faces persistent challenges in achieving optimal cow longevity, with health - and fertility -related disorders still remaining the predominant causes of premature cullings. Given the strong influence of age, parity, and yi eld on the distribution of culling reasons, there is a clear need for detailed herd -level analyses. The present study therefore investigates the relationships between cow age, lactation number, milk yield, and culling causes",agriculture-15-02529.pdf

Animals This study was conducted on a large -scale Holstein –Friesian dairy farm owned by MILKMEN Ltd., which is a part of CERES HOLDING Plc., located in Tolna County near Paks in the South Transdanubian region of Hungary. The area is characterized by a con- tinental climate with warm, dry summers and cold winters. The farm maintains a herd of 480 lactating Holstein –Friesian cows of a similar age and operates an intensive commer- cial production system. The farm is equipped with advanced production technology, in- cluding eight Lely milking robots functioning in a free -flow traffic system, which allows voluntary milking attendance and provides improved herd management efficiency. This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected herd record data from this single dairy farm. 2.2. Dataset Data were exported in 2022 from the RISKA farm’s herd management software, which integrates animal identification, health events, reproductive records, and disposal (culling) information. The observational unit was the individual cow. The analytical dataset comprised 2057 cows, of which 590 were in first parity, 614 in second, 436 in third, 263 in fourth, and 154 in fifth or higher lactations at the time of culling or censoring. Only animals that had calved at least once (parity ≥ 1) and were part of the lactating herd were included; nulliparous heifers and calves were not considered. Within the observation window, 1480 animals experienced a definitive culling event and 577 were administratively right -censored. Birth dates ranged from 24 August 2003 to 13 August 2019; culling events occurred between 6 January 2015 and 13 May 2021. Cows present in the herd on 14 May 2021 were censored on that date. Age at culling (or",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,7,"censoring) was calculated as the number of days from birth to the date of definitive removal from the herd (or to the censoring date), and all time variables were expressed in days. All Hol- stein–Friesian cows with complete identification and date fields required to define entry and culling and with a clearly specified reason fo r removal from the herd were included; no records were excluded during data preparation. The primary outcome was definitive culling from the herd. For cows with multiple interim events, only the final removal was considered; thus, each recorded culling reason represents the ultimate cause of disposal. Cows still in production at the administra tive end of follow -up were treated as right -censored. All time variables were expressed in days. Two main explanatory variables were considered in the analyses. Parity at event was defined as the number of completed lactations at the time of culling or censoring. The culling reason, representing the mutually exclusive and final cause of removal, was c ate- gorized into six groups: udder problems, metabolic problems, locomotive problems, re- productive problems, low milk production, and other. The “other” category included in- frequent causes such as accidents, pneumonia, or undiagnosed diseases. Each cow was assigned to one category only, corresponding to the ultimate reason for definitive removal from the herd. 2.3. Statistical Analyses All statistical analyses were performed in R 4.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Com- puting, Vienna, Austria).",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,8,"Descriptive and comparative analyses were first conducted to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset. Distributions of age at culling (or age at censoring) and par- ity were described using medians, interquartile ranges, minima, and maxima, while c ull- ing reasons were expressed as counts and percentages. Differences in parity among cull- ing reason categories were assessed with the Kruskal –Wallis test, and when significant, pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn’s post hoc test with Bonferroni adjust- ment. Group proportions were compared using the Chi -square test. To further investigate longevity patterns, survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, with time from birth to culling or censoring as the outcome varia- ble. Survival functions were estimated for the entire herd and then stratified by par ity and by culling reason. Differences between survival distributions were tested using the log - rank test, with a two -sided significance level of α = 0.05. Survival curves were plotted with 95% confidence intervals and included risk tables at regular time intervals. 3. Results 3.1. Distribution of Culling Reasons The descriptive analysis of culling reasons revealed that health -related disorders were the predominant drivers of cow removals from the herd. Udder problems, which include clinical and subclinical mastitis as well as chronic teat and gland issues, account ed for the largest share of cullings (22.8%). This was followed by metabolic disorders (18.2%), locomotive or lameness problems (17.3%), and reproductive failures (17.1%). By compar- ison, low milk yield was responsible for only 11.0% of culling cases, while “other” reasons such as accidents, injuries, or unspecified factors contributed 13.5%. The distribution of culling reasons differed significantly among categories (Chi -square = 380.2, p < 0.001). The predominance of udder, metabolic, and reproductive disorders underscores that involun- tary culling associated with impaired health far outweighs planned",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,9,"removals based solely on production levels. 3.2. Age at Culling The distribution of age at culling showed a marked peak between 1200 and 1400 days, which is equal to approximately 3.5 –4 years regarding the age of cows (Figure 1). This age range represented the most prevalent stage for removal from the herd. The distrib ution was clearly right -skewed: while the majority of cows left the herd relatively young, a small subset achieved substantially longer lifespans, with some individuals remaining in pro- duction until 4000 –5000 days (10 –13 years). Although biologically possi ble, such extended longevity was rare in the studied herd, highlighting that under prevailing management and health conditions, only a minority of cows survive long enough to reach their maxi- mum productive potential. The high concentration of removals befo re 1500–2000 days also aligns with the average timing of second and third lactations, suggesting that many cows fail to progress beyond these economically critical stages.",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,10,"1. Introduction Dairy cow longevity is a key factor in the sustainability of modern dairy farming, which is linked to farm profitability, environmental efficiency, and animal welfare. Ex- tending the productive lifespan enables the high rearing and development costs of heif ers to be distributed over more lactations, thereby increasing lifetime returns per cow [1,2]. Conversely, high replacement rates increase financial burdens and environmental im- pacts associated with raising calves [3,4].

8,11,"Figure 1. Histogram of cow age at culling. 3.3. Parity at Culling Analysis of parity revealed that the majority of cows were removed after their second or third lactations. Overall, the numbers of cows in parities 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5 were 590, 614, 436, 263, and 154, respectively (Figure 2). Median values ranged between t wo and three lactations across all culling categories, reinforcing the observation that most cows fail to reach the stage where they are both biologically mature and maximally profitable. How- ever, the distribution showed heterogeneity. Some cows were culle d as early as their first lactation, while others remained productive for six to eight lactations and, in some cases, up to ten. Parity at culling differed significantly among culling reason categories (Krus- kal–Wallis test, χ2(5) = 28.81, p < 0.001). Cows culled for udder problems (mean rank = 808.6), metabolic disorders (776.4), and other causes (764.8) tended to be of higher parity at removal than those culled for reproductive problems (640.5), locomotive disorders (719.8), or low milk production (6 97.8). This finding suggests distinct life -course trajecto- ries of risk: fertility and locomotive problems jeopardize animals early, while metabolic wear-and-tear accumulates with advancing age. Figure 2.

8,12,"3.4. Survival Analysis The Kaplan –Meier survival analysis for the entire herd provided further insights into the overall longevity profile (Figure 3). The survival curve declined steeply during the first 1000 –1500 days of life after calving, reflecting a high proportion of early cullings. Thereafter, the curve flattened gradually, with survival probability decreasing more slowly until approximately 4000 –5000 days. By 1500 –2000 days, that is, equal approxi- mately 4 –5.5 years of age, around half of the population had been culled. Th ese results confirm that the economically productive lifespan of most cows is relatively short, with many individuals leaving the herd before they can capitalize on their most profitable lac- tations. Only a minority of animals achieved extended longevity, d emonstrating that while long -lived cows exist, they represent an exception rather than the norm under pre- sent herd conditions. Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier survival curve for the whole studied population. 3.5. Survival by Parity When survival curves were studied according to parity, a clear differentiation emerged between life -course groups (Figure 4). These differences were statistically signif- icant (log -rank test: χ2(4) = 2231.45, p < 0.001). Cows culled during their first lactation showed a sharp decline in survival probability around 1000 days, underscoring the vul- nerability of primiparous animals to early culling. In contrast, cows in their second and third lactations exhibited su rvival curves shifted toward later ages, with most cullings occurring between 1500 and 2500 days. Fourth -lactation cows demonstrated even longer survival, with curves extending to 3000 days or more, while animals that reached five or more lactations often remained productive for exceptionally long periods, exceeding 4000 days. Although these long -lived cows were few in number, their contribution to the herd was disproportionate, providing both significant lifetime milk yield and potential genetic value.",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,13,"4. Discussion The present work aimed to study the main reasons for culling in a dairy herd in Hun- gary and evaluated how age, parity, and yield affected culling patterns, using descriptive statistics and survival analyses. The results clearly indicated that most cows wer e culled prematurely after the second or third lactation and that the overwhelming majority of culls were involuntary, caused by health -related disorders rather than economic reasons. Udder problems, reproductive failures, metabolic disorders, and locomoti ve problems ac- counted for more than two -thirds of all cullings, whereas low milk yield alone explained only a small portion. These findings are not only consistent with previous research [2,11,17–19] but also confirm the large body of evidence showing that cow longevity is driven less by productivity itself and more by health and fertility limitations. Although this analysis was conducted using data from a single large -scale Holstein –Friesian herd, the farm’s high -yielding cows, uniform genetic background, typical Hungarian forage - based total mixed ration, and modern milking technology are representative of intensive dairy production systems in Hungary. Therefore, the results are considered to have rele- vance beyond the studied herd. 4.1. Health -Related Drivers of Culling The most prominent cause of culling was udder health problems (22.8%). Mastitis has been repeatedly identified as one of the leading causes of premature culling world- wide, in all kind of systems [12,18,20]. Clinical mastitis reduces both the quality and th e quantity of milk, incurs veterinary and treatment costs, and imposes milk withdrawal pe- riods, all of which make cows unprofitable and often lead to their culling [21,22]. How- ever, udder problems are not merely an economic issue but also a major welfare c oncern, as mastitis causes pain, inflammation, and systemic illness [5,23]. Thus, the high propor- tion of",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,14,"mastitis -related culls in this study underscores the dual challenge of safeguarding profitability and welfare. Similar patterns were reported by ref. [ 13] in a Hungarian dairy herd, where udder health problems accounted for about 30% of all culling cases, confirm- ing that mastitis remains one of the leading causes of early removal under domestic pro- duction conditions. Reproductive problems (17.1%) also co ntributed substantially to early removals. Fertility decline has long been recognized as a global issue in high -yielding dairy systems [24 –26]. Infertility or repeat breeding not only delays calving intervals but also increases replacement pressure when co nception fails despite multiple inseminations [27,28]. The multifactorial origin of fertility -related culling includes postpartum uterine diseases, metabolic stress, and genetic predisposition, representing the complexity of managing reproductive efficienc y [25,27,29]. Lameness and locomotive disorders (17.3%) represented another major cause of in- voluntary culling. Numerous studies report that 10 –20% of dairy cows are removed due to lameness, particularly in high -producing Holstein herds [23,30,31]. Lame cows exhibit reduced mobility, impaired grazing and feeding, decreased reproductive performance, and higher susceptibility to secondary diseases, which together increase the likelihood of culling [32,33]. It is important to note that lameness is also one of the most visib le welfare issues in dairy farming, drawing significant public and ethical attention [23,34]. Metabolic problems (18.2%) were common in older and higher -parity cows, in ac- cordance with the literature showing that energy balance challenges, such as ketosis or displaced abomasum, accumulate as animals age and as milk yields increase [17,27,35]. These disorders often arise around the transition period and compromise both productiv- ity and survival [29,36]. The finding that metabolic disorders were strongly linked to higher-parity removals suggests that preventive health programs focusing on transition cow management may significantly improve longevity outcomes.",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,15,"4.2. Age and Parity Patterns Our results showed that most cows were culled at 1200 –1400 days (3.5 –4 years), con- sistent with the time of the second and third lactations. This pattern aligns with studies from North America and Europe, where the average productive lifespan is 3 –4 lactations [1,3,6,37]. Although a small subset of cows in this study reached 4000 –5000 days (10 –12 years), these cases were rare, supporting evidence that while extended longevity is bio- logically feasible, it is seldom achieved in commercial herds [9]. Parity-specific results further demonstrated that reproductive and locomotive prob- lems were more common in younger cows, often leading to cullings after the first or sec- ond lactation, whereas metabolic problems accumulated with age, causing cullings later in cows’ life. These life -course trajectories align with findings from refs. [10,11,17], show- ing that disease risks shift with parity. Early culling of primiparous cows has serious eco- nomic implications, as these animals rarely recover their rearing costs before their third lactation [1,7]. Preventing early removals is therefore one of the most effective strategies to improve herd profitability and sustainability [2,37]. 4.3. Survival Analysis and Longevity The Kaplan –Meier survival curve indicated that 50% of the herd was culled by 1500 – 2000 days (4 –5.5 years), consistent with survival profiles reported by refs. [3,19,37]. Group- ing by parity revealed that cows surviving to their fourth or fifth lactation ach ieved mark- edly longer lifespans, often exceeding 3000 days. These long -lived cows, though relatively few, have been shown to deliver disproportionate economic returns by reducing replace- ment costs and maximizing milk yield over their lifetime [7,9]. Grouping by culling reason further clarified that reproductive failures and low yield truncated lifespan earlier, while locomotive and metabolic disorders were associated with later cullings. Similar patterns",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,16,"have been reported by several authors [10,12,38 ]. 4.4. Implications for Farm Management, Welfare and Sustainability From an economic point of view, premature culling before the third lactation pre- vents farms from recovering rearing costs [1,7]. Extending average longevity reduces the annual replacement rate, saving on heifer -rearing costs, which can represent up to 20 –25% of dairy farm expenses [2,35]. Long -lived cows dilute these costs over more productive years, thereby improving profitability [39,40]. From a welfare perspective, the predominance of health -related cullings indicates that cow well -being is often compromised before culling. Lameness and mastitis, for ex- ample, are painful conditions that not only precipitate culling but also raise serious e thical concerns [23,34,41]. Therefore, reducing involuntary culling is aligned with both ethical imperatives and consumer expectations regarding animal welfare [5]. From an environmental perspective, extended cow longevity has a direct sustaina- bility benefit. Raising replacements requires large amounts of feed, water, and land, while emitting greenhouse gases. By reducing replacement rates and increasing the proportio n of lifetime spent in production, farms can substantially lower their per -unit milk carbon footprint [4,40]. This makes longevity a key lever for achieving climate goals in the dairy sector. 5. Conclusions Within the studied high -yield Holstein –Friesian herd in Hungary, most cows were culled prematurely, with the majority of culling events occurring between the second and third lactations and around 1500 –2000 days of life. Health -related problems, rather tha n economic considerations, drive most cullings. Udder disorders, metabolic problems,",agriculture-15-02529.pdf
8,17,"locomotive problems, and reproductive disorders together accounted for more than two - thirds of all cullings, while low milk yield alone explained only a minor part. Distinct patterns were observed across life stages. Younger cows, particularly in their fir st and second lactations, were most vulnerable to early culling due to fertility problems and lo- comotive disorders, reflecting the fragility of primiparous animals. In contrast, older cows were more frequently culled due to metabolic problems and chronic h ealth conditions that accumulate with age and repeated calvings. Although a small subset of cows survived well beyond the herd’s average lifespan and contributed disproportionately to milk out- put and genetic value, such cases remained rare under current ma nagement conditions. These findings underline the urgent need for targeted strategies to address stage -specific risks: reproductive and locomotor health programs for young cows and preventive meta- bolic management for higher -parity animals. Although the fin dings were derived from a single herd, its characteristics closely reflect large Hungarian dairy systems, supporting the wider applicability of these findings. By focusing on the health and reproductive prob- lems identified in this study , Hungarian dairy farms can extend productive lifespan, re- duce involuntary culling, and enhance the overall efficiency, profitability, and welfare of their herds.

Survival by Culling Reason Survival analysis grouped by culling reason revealed distinct temporal patterns (log - rank test: χ2(5) = 1.80, p = 0.876; Figure 5). Cows culled for reproductive problems and low milk yield showed reduced survival probabilities earlier in life, indicating a tendency for earlier removal. In contrast, cows removed due to metabolic and locomotive disorders, as well as those grou ped under “other reasons”, tended to remain in production longer be- fore culling. These patterns suggest that different causes of remova l follow unique risk patterns: reproductive failures and production insufficiencies tend to truncate the produc- tive lifespan prematurely, while chronic metabolic or locomotive conditions accumulate gradually and manifest in later lactations. Although the o verall survival distributions did not differ significantly between culling reasons, this apparent heterogeneity of risk sup- ports the need to tailor herd health and management strategies to specific vulnerabilities at different stages of life of the animals .

9,1,"Jordan's agricultural sector is confronted with significant obstacles that jeopardize its long-term viability and the nation’s food security. These difficulties arise from a mix of limited water availability, harsh climatic conditions, and political instability in the region. They are further compounded by economic factors such as unemployment, rising food prices, and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has further strained food systems, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities in the sector. A critical issue facing agriculture in Jordan is the fragmentation of farmland, where many rural households own multiple, non-contiguous plots scattered across different areas. This pattern highlights inefficiencies in land governance, underdeveloped land tenure frameworks, and weak spatial planning. As a result, farmers struggle to scale their operations effectively, which limits profitability and contributes to environmental harm, including soil degradation and erosion [25]. Despite government interventions such as water-use subsidies, import tariffs, and export levies, the cost of agricultural operations has continued to rise. Although labor expenses have declined due to an influx of lower-cost foreign workers, investments in human capital deliver a lower economic return than capital investments. Nonetheless, many farmers still opt for inexpensive labor, as the costs of essential agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and agrochemicals remain high. A further constraint is the lack of access to advanced, efficient farming technologies, which prevents farmers from modernizing their operations or benefiting from economies of scale. The dominance of middlemen in the supply chain also diminishes farmers' earnings, as they receive minimal returns on their produce in both domestic and export markets. Financial institutions and credit mechanisms often do not adequately serve this group, hindering agricultural expansion. Farmers cooperatives, in particular, face difficulties in absorbing financial pressures and are often unable to coordinate effectively, which weakens the sector’s capacity to scale up operations",1_2.txt
9,2,"in priority areas [25]. Climate change further complicates these challenges, with declining rainfall, rising drought frequency, and worsening land degradation. These effects severely impact productivity, especially for farmers relying on rain-fed crops and livestock grazing. This environmental stress has contributed to reduced agricultural output among small scale producers. Although agriculture accounted for just 5.2% of Jordan’s GDP in 2020 [26] and rose modestly to 6% by 2023, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, its broader economic influence is substantial. Through its extended value chain, the sector contributes roughly 25–30% to the economy. Jordan has achieved self-reliance in several agricultural commodities, such as fruits, vegetables, poultry, olive oil, and eggs. However, it remains dependent on imports of staple goods such as wheat, barley, and red meat [27]. In 2022, Jordan ranked 47th out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Government-Backed Loans Program in Supporting Small-Scale Farmers 5 Index (GFSI), with a score of 66.2 out of 100, reflecting its overall performance across the GFSI’s four key dimensions. These pillars are economic resilience (affordability), production and agricultural resilience (availability), nutritional resilience (quality and safety), and environmental resilience (sustainability and adaptation) [28]. The prevalence of undernourishment was 8.5% and the number of undernourished was 0.9 million out of the total population in Jordan between 2017 and 2019 [29]. However, these numbers are expected to increase due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the negative impact of climate change, and the deterioration of land and water resources. The post COVID-19 period has further weakened the economy, adding to this fragility",1_2.txt
10,1,"Dominant and persistent acoustic landscape features, such as rushing water, crashing surf anthropogenic noise (e.g., traffic noise), and chorusing animals can structure animal assemblages by providing fitness-enhancing habitat cues [1, 7]. Some soundscapes announce opportunities; for example, chorusing frogs serve as acoustic beacons guiding the dispersal of frogs and newts to breeding ponds, and female meadow katydids use mixed-species insect choruses to locate aggregations of males [8-11]. Alternatively, a soundscape may signal heightened predation risk [12], reduced foraging efficiency due to masked prey cues or distraction [12-14]. For example, pallid bats are slower to localize prey-generated sounds, regardless of whether environmental noise overlaps spectrally with prey cues [14]. Tropical irrigated rice paddies, as cultivated wet grasslands, are species-rich and often noisy habitats harboring vocalizing anurans birds and insects whose auditory presence can indicate various stages of the rice growth cycle. For example, anuran mating choruses mark the flooding of paddies and a crescendo of vocalizing insects signals rice maturation and canopy closure [15-21]. In addition to animal-generated sounds audible to humans, ultrasonic sounds are also an integral component of the rice acoustic environment (Fig. 1a). Sonar pulses emitted by insectivorous echolocating bats are a prominent feature of the soundscape, especially over newly planted rice paddies [22]. As the rice matures, aggregations of meadow katydid males (Conocephalini, Conocephalus spp.) broadcast an intense, broadband, ultrasonic call (> 90 dB at 1 m, SPL; 30-90 kHz to conspecific females [11,26]. Individual males produce a call sequence comprising several short-duration (< 20 ms) ticks similar to bat sonar pulses, followed by a rapid series of ticks or “buzzes”. An aggregation of calling males produces a chorus so ubiquitous and intense in late growth stages that it appears to deter foraging bats whose sonar overlaps with it in frequency [23]. However, despite this, and despite",1_3.txt
10,2,"the fact that these ultrasonic choruses are a prominent and predictable acoustic feature of one of the oldest (9000 mya) and most extensive crops in tropical Asia (48 million hectares; https://www.irri.org/), it is unknown whether rice-associated arthropods attend to the chorus.The rice-associated arthropod assemblage represents a complex food web comprising detritivores, herbivores, predators, and parasitoids that accumulate in a predictable fashion over the growing season [20,27–29]; (Fig. 1b ,c). These include species with a known ability to detect and respond to sounds in their environment (e.g., eared moths, crickets, katydids [30, 31], and many more whose auditory capacity has yet to be tested. Arthropods indifferent to the chorus may be unable to detect the sound stimulus, either because they lack hearing organs, have a high auditory response threshold, or are insensitive to ultrasound. Others may be capable of detecting the chorus but may ignore it as irrelevant [32]. Alternatively, the ultrasonic chorus may attract arthropods that associate it with food (e.g., herbivores and predators of herbivores), host plants for egg-laying, or safety [23, 33]. Conversely, the ultrasonic chorus may provide a warning of suboptimal habitat, especially since meadow katydids not only produce a noisy backdrop that can mask important signals or cues (e.g., ultrasonic moth courtship calls [34]) but are also predators of insect eggs [35]. Moreover, it is possible that insects with sensitive anti-bat predator hearing (e.g., noctuid moths [36]) mistake the ultrasonic ticks of meadow katydids for bat sonar pulses and are repelled by the chorus. In addition to these potential direct effects, the ultrasonic katydid chorus may elicit indirect effects on dispersing rice-associated arthropods through their predators. For example, Sedlock et al. demonstrated that the chorus deterred aerial-hawking bats whose echolocation calls overlapped in spectral frequency with the katydids’ [23]. This enemy-reduced space may result in more",1_3.txt
10,3,"dispersing arthropods irrespective of their hearing ability. Alternatively, the chorus may attract gleaning bats that eavesdrop on katydid calls but but are also capable of capturing aerial prey. We used an aggregation of 100 ultrasonic speakers to mimic a meadow katydid chorus in a newly planted tropical irrigated rice field that was free of naturally calling katydids. This “phantom chorus” modified soundscape primarily aimed to test whether aerial insectivorous bats were deterred by the ultrasonic chorus ([23]). However, systematic sampling of aerial arthropods documenting bat prey availability offered an opportunity to document the accumulation of dispersing arthropods over maturing rice—adding to the existing literature that reports primarily on canopy-sampled arthropods—and to test for responses of rice-associated arthropods to the ultrasonic insect chorus. Our study is primarily exploratory, given that documentation of hearing in arthropods is limited, and it is plausible that the chorus may influence even non-hearing taxa indirectly through bat (or other) predators. Therefore, we first pooled all arthropods within each rice stage-associated guild to test whether arthropod responses to the phantom chorus were guild-specific. Then, to better detect potential behavioral responses of taxa with members that have confirmed ultrasonic hearing, we reanalyzed the data by taxonomic family. We hypothesized that if the chorus serves as a habitat beacon, guilds that would normally arrive during later (noisier) growth stages, such as predators and herbivores, would be attracted to newly planted paddies, resulting in more captures during chorus-on versus chorus-off time blocks and in the playback paddy versus the two control paddies. Alternatively, if the chorus is associated with high predation risk or is simply distracting to a particular guild or taxonomic family, we predicted fewer captures during chorus-on versus chorus-off time blocks and in the playback paddy compared to the control paddies.",1_3.txt
11,1,"RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Free access to antiretroviral treatment and protection against the risk of catastrophic health expenditure in people living with HIV: evidence from Cameroon Marwân-al-Qays Bousmah1,2*, Marie Libérée Nishimwe1, Christopher Kuaban3and Sylvie Boyer1 Abstract Background: To foster access to care and reduce the burden of health expenditures on people living with HIV (PLHIV), several sub-Saharan African countries, including Cameroon, have adopted a policy of removing HIV-related fees, especially for antiretroviral treatment (ART). We investigate the impact of Cameroon ’s free antiretroviral treatment (ART) policy, enacted in May 2007, on catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) risk according to socioeconomic status, in PLHIV enrolled in the country ’s treatment access program. Methods: Based on primary data from two cross-sectional surveys of PLHIV outpatients in 2006 –2007 and 2014 (i.e., before and after the policy ’s implementation, respectively), we used inverse propensity score weighting to reduce covariate imbalances between participants in both surveys, combined with probit regressions of CHE incidence. The analysis included participants treated with ART in one of the 11 HIV services common to both surveys ( n= 1275). Results: The free ART policy was associated with a significantly lower risk of CHE only in the poorest PLHIV while no significant effect was found in lower-middle or upper socioeconomic status PLHIV. Unexpectedly, the risk of CHE was higher in those with middle socioeconomic status after the policy ’s implementation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Cameroon ’s free ART policy is pro-poor. As it only benefitted PLHIV with the lowest socioeconomic status, increased comprehensive HIV care coverage is needed to substantially reduce the risk of CHE and the associated risk of impoverishment for all PLHIV.

11,3,"Introduction Universal health coverage is a major target for health re- form in many countries and a priority of the Sustainable Development Goals. The development of health insur- ance schemes and the removal of user fees for specific populations and/or key health services are considered core actions to achieve this target [ 1]. People living with HIV (PLHIV) constitute an espe- cially vulnerable population as they bear particularly large disease-related health expenses which may severely affect their household welfare [ 2]. Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) - which assess the financial hardship caused by out-of-pocket payments for health on house- hold welfare - is very high in this population, although some studies suggest that access to antiretroviral treat- ment (ART) and longer time on ART may decrease its risk [ 3,4]. To foster access to care and reduce the bur- den of health expenditures on PLHIV, several sub- Saharan African countries, including Cameroon, have adopted a policy of removing ART-related fees. How- ever, evidence for this policy ’s success is limited. In par- ticular, little is known about the effects of free ART on CHE according to PLHIV socioeconomic status, and es- pecially on the financial risks faced by the poorest groups in this vulnerable population. This information is crucial for decision makers, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current policy and tailor future policy accordingly. The Cameroonian health system is mainly financed by private health expenditures through out-of-pocket pay- ments, the latter accounting for 71% of current health expenditures in 2017 [ 5]. Following a recent multi- country study which estimated CHE incidence in 2014 in Cameroon ’s general population at 3% - using the common thresholds of 10% of total consumption or 40% of non- food consumption - the country was classified in the sec- ond highest quintile",s12913-021-06331-5.pdf
11,4,"of CHE incidence worldwide [ 6]. Furthermore, Cameroon is one of the countries most affected by the HIV epidemic in West and Central Af- rica, with a prevalence estimated at 3.6% in 2018 in adults aged 15 –49 years [ 7]. In 2001, the government launched a national treatment access program based on a strategy of HIV care decentralization, whereby ART was delivered at the district level [ 8]. This provided healthcare facilities a relatively large degree of autonomy in terms of the design of user fee schemes, resulting in price differentiation in healthcare facilities across the country. However, ART prices were fixed and were sub- sidized by the government [ 9]. A study conducted in 2006 –2007 showed that, overall, decentralization had a protective effect on the risk of CHE in PLHIV [ 9]. How- ever, 39.6% of this population risked CHE at the thresh- old of 20% of household income, with an even higher risk for the poorest individuals. In May 2007, thenational authorities decided to provide ART for free to facilitate access to treatment and remove financial bar- riers. However, user fees continued to apply to all other HIV services, including consultations and biological tests. This study aimed to explore the differential effects of the free ART policy on the risk of CHE according to so- cioeconomic status in PLHIV enrolled in Cameroon ’s ART access program. Data Study design We used data from two cross-sectional surveys con- ducted in 2006 –2007 and 2014 in PLHIV outpatients at- tending HIV services participating in the Cameroonian ART access program. The first survey, entitled EVAL (ANRS-12116), included 3151 HIV-positive outpatients consulting in 27 HIV services in 6 of the country ’s 10 re- gions [ 8]. The second survey, entitled EVOLCam (ANRS-12288), included 2130 participants consulting in 19 HIV",s12913-021-06331-5.pdf

In order to study evolutions in the program over time, both surveys used the same design and proce- dures, which are described in detail elsewhere [ 11]. Briefly, outpatients diagnosed HIV-positive at least 3 months previously and aged ≥21 years were randomly selected for inclusion. All participants provided written consent before data collection. They answered a face-to- face questionnaire documenting socioeconomic charac- teristics, household consumption, healthcare use and re- lated expenditures. Blood samples were also collected and analyzed in a reference laboratory in Yaoundé for viral load and CD4 cell count measurements. Clinical data were obtained from both clinical examination and retrospective medical files using a standardized medical questionnaire. The EVAL (ANRS-12116) and the EVOLCam (ANRS- 12288) surveys were both approved by the Ministry of Public Health in Cameroon and the Cameroonian Na- tional Ethics Committee. Study population The study population for the present analysis included participants treated with ART for at least 1 month either in 2006 –2007 (EVAL survey) or in 2014 (EVOLCam sur- vey) in one of the 11 HIV services participating in both surveys ( n= 1275, i.e., 615 and 660 participants, respectively). Variables The outcome of interest was a binary variable measuring CHE incidence. Using a standard method, CHE was de- fined as out-of-pocket payments for health accountingBousmah et al.

11,6,"for 40% or more of a household ’s capacity to pay (i.e., the income remaining after subsistence needs are met) [ 12]. The following socioeconomic and clinical variables were included in the analysis as determinants of CHE: wealth level (which depending on the model was assessed either by i) the log of the monthly equivalized consumption expenditure (continuous variable) or ii) the monthly equivalized consumption expenditure in deciles (categorical variable)), age, gender, level of formal educa- tion, marital status, being the head of the household, having an economic activity, time (in months) since ART initiation and CD4 cell count at the time of the survey (< 200 versus ≥200cells/mm3). We also included i) a decentralization variable to indicate each HIV ser- vice ’s decentralization level (i.e., central or district) and ii) the survey period (2006 –2007, i.e., before the free ART policy ’s implementation versus 2014, i.e., after its implementation). A full description of the variables is presented in Supplementary Table S1. Methods We implemented an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) technique in order to reduce covariate imbalances between ‘treated ’and ‘untreated ’individuals (i.e., participants in the 2014 survey who benefited from the free ART policy and participants in the 2006 –2007 survey who did not, respectively). This methodology, which is part of the general framework developed by Rosenbaum & Rubin [ 13] for estimating average treat- ment effects (ATE), allowed us to reduce any possible bias when estimating the policy ’s causal effect on CHE. IPTW is widely used for estimating ATE in the presence of selection bias related to sample selection or stratifica- tion based on covariates [ 14]. More specifically, it con- sists in weighting the ‘treated ’group by the inverse of the propensity score. The rationale behind using the in- verse propensity score lies in",s12913-021-06331-5.pdf
11,7,"the so-called “double ro- bustness ”result, implying that the ATE is consistent if at least one of the conditional mean functions of the re- sponse or the propensity score model is correctly speci- fied [ 15]. First, we estimated the propensity score of the treat- ment (i.e. benefitting from the policy) using a probit model including the explanatory variables listed in the Variables subsection above. Balance properties were ana- lyzed using a standard approach [ 16]. We then estimated a probit model weighted by the inverse probability of treatment to identify the determinants of CHE and more specifically the effect of the free ART policy. The latter analysis was restricted to the region of common support. Finally, two alternative model specifications were consid- ered to investigate the impact of the policy on the risk of CHE according to socioeconomic status. The first speci- fication included the continuous equivalizedconsumption expenditure variable and an interaction of this variable with the free ART policy variable, to test whether the policy had pro-poor effects (i.e., decreased the probability of CHE more in poorer individuals than in others). The second specification included the equiva- lized consumption expenditure variable in deciles and an interaction of this variable with the free ART policy vari- able, to test whether the effect of the policy differed ac- cording to socioeconomic status. As the data source consisted of two cross-sectional surveys, one before and one after the policy ’s implemen- tation in 2007, an ‘omitted variable ’bias due to poten- tially unobserved factors cannot be ruled out. To limit this bias, we adjusted the different models for the level of HIV service decentralization, as a previous study con- ducted in the first phase of Cameroon ’s ART access pro- gram showed that linkage to care at the district level was",s12913-021-06331-5.pdf
11,8,"associated with a lower risk of CHE [ 9]. Furthermore, as the policy may have influenced CHE in ways other than direct cost reduction - for instance, by improving access to care which in turn resulted in fewer adverse health events - we also controlled for health-related variables (e.g., CD4 cell count at the time of the survey). Results Main characteristics of the study population according to each survey period CHE incidence was 22% in 2006 –2007 but only 15% in 2014 (see Supplementary Table S2). The mean monthly equivalized consumption expenditure was very similar in both periods (US$91 in 2006 –2007 and US$90 in 2014). Mean age was 39 and 42 years in 2006 –2007 and 2014, respectively. Finally, women accounted for 68 and 71% of the study population, respectively. Inverse probability of treatment weighting ATE estimation Ninety-eight participants of the total 1275 participants were outside the region of common support and thus were excluded from the current analysis. The balancing property of the propensity score was satisfied (see Sup- plementary Table S3). Details on the inverse probability weighting estimation of the ATE are provided in Supple- mentary Table S4and balancing results in Supplemen- tary Table S5. Results from the overidentification test for covariate balance ( p= 0.41) showed that most of the bias between ‘treated ’and ‘untreated ’individuals was re- moved. Our methodological choice was justified, as ATE estimation without addressing covariate imbalances be- tween ‘treated ’and untreated ”individuals yielded a sig- nificant but biased ATE of −0.0509 ( p= 0.047). Using the IPTW estimator, the ATE of the free ART policy on CHE was not significant.Bousmah et al. BMC Health Services Research (2021) 21:313 Page 3 of 7",s12913-021-06331-5.pdf

These amounts were below Cameroon ’s official minimum wage in 2014 (US$62/month) [ 17].

11,10,"other wealth deciles. Discussion Our findings suggest that the free ART policy intro- duced in Cameroon in 2007 had a different impact on the risk of CHE depending on PLHIV socioeconomic status. More precisely, PLHIV in the lowest and second- lowest wealth deciles benefited from a 23.7 and 10.8 per- centage point decrease in CHE risk, respectively. Ac- cordingly, the policy was pro-poor. Conversely, PLHIV in the fifth wealth decile had a 7.4 percentage point in- creased CHE risk, while for all other wealth deciles the risk of CHE remained relatively stable before and after the introduction of the policy. These findings might be explained by the fact that concurrently with the policy ’s adoption, out-of-pocket spending for certain health goods and services increased. Our data showed that ex- penditures for biological tests almost doubled between 2006 and 2007 and 2014 ( p< 0.001), while other spend- ing categories (consultation fees, hospital bills, other medications, and traditional medicine) remained stable (see Supplementary Table S2). However, this increase (whether demand- or supply-driven) was mostly ob- served in the middle socioeconomic group.

11,11,"significant increase in CHE risk observed in PLHIV in the fifth wealth decile may also be related to a phenomenon revealed by Wagstaff & Lindelow [ 18]i n China. In that study, the authors highlighted that health insurance substantially increased the risk of high and catastrophic health spending, as individuals received more sophisticated and expensive medical care once insured. Our findings have important implications for HIV healthcare policy. They suggest that removing ART fees is a pro-poor measure. CHE incidence significantly re- duced in poorer PLHIV in Cameroon between the two study time points. Although much higher in this popula- tion in 2006 –2007, it was similar or even lower to that observed in wealthier PLHIV in 2014. However, the free ART policy alone seemed to be insufficient to effectively protect all PLHIV against the financial risk related to their infection, as suggested by the continued high level of CHE incidence in 2014 across all socioeconomic groups (from 11.5% for the second lowest decile to 23.9% for the 6th decile). Increased comprehensive HIV care coverage is necessary to significantly lower the risk of CHE and related impoverishment in the PLHIV popu- lation in Cameroon and elsewhere. In 2019, the coun- try’s health authorities took an important step in this direction by providing free comprehensive care, includ- ing consultations, biological tests and prophylaxis drugs, to all PLHIV [ 19]. Further research is needed to inform policymakers about the impact of the roll-out of the free HIV care policy on socioeconomic inequalities. The removal of user fees for HIV care, initiated in Cameroon in 2007 with the adoption of free ART and pursued in 2019 with the removal of user fees for all other HIV services, raised the question of the funding of these measures and, in turn, of the budget reforms",s12913-021-06331-5.pdf
11,12,"required to compensate providers for lost fee revenue [ 20]. Not com- pensating for this loss of revenue may impede the qualityof care and lead to adverse effects such as drug shortages [21], which may result in increasing access to private and costly care and, in turn, increase out-of-pocket payments for health care. However, some studies suggested that the increase of public health expenditures required to fund free care may be not financially sustainable for national governments in the long term [ 22]. This issue is part of a more general discussion on the financing of UHC policies in developing countries. A recent study suggested that a fi- nancing of UHC through consumption taxation was the best policy option, in terms of both fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity [ 23]. Our main study limitation is the risk of ‘omitted vari- able ’bias in the estimation of the free ART policy effect. Although we used the IPTW method to address issues re- lated to sample selection bias and stratification, and ad- justed the models for other factors that may have influenced CHE, we cannot fully exclude it. We therefore acknowledge that the estimated differences presented here may not be entirely attributable to the free ART policy. In conclusion, Cameroon ’s free ART policy seems to have significantly reduced CHE incidence for the poorest PLHIV after its introduction in 2007. The constant, and in some cases, increased spending for certain healthcare costs items such as biological tests, might explain why other socioeconomic groups did not benefit from this policy and remained at a high risk of CHE. Increased comprehensive coverage of HIV care is needed to sub- stantially reduce the risk of CHE and associated impoverishment.

Biomass fuel and air pollution are major risk factors with distinct pathophysiology. • The ‘eosinophilic’ endotype in COPD is biologically distinct from asthma. • PRISm, FEV1/FVC Z- scores, and quantitative CT improve early COPD detection. • Dupilumab (anti- IL- 4/IL- 13) improved exacerbations and lung function in COPD with blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL. Mechanisms are currently being investigated. • Smoking cessation remains pivotal. Nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) can guide pharmacotherapy. Cytisine and varenicline are effective; e- cigarettes pose safety concerns. • Mood disorders and dysfunctional breathing are common in COPD. Addressing these can reduce symptom burden and im - prove quality of life. • Comorbidity management, particularly of cardiovascular risk, obesity, and sleep- disordered breathing, is integral to holistic COPD care. 1 | Introduction Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a common airway disease which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality glob - ally. Over the past three decades, COPD ranked as the third lead - ing cause of death worldwide, until dropping to fourth place in 2021 due to the emergence of",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,2,"COVID- 19. The mortality rates are higher in South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania [ 1]. In addition to health- related issues, COPD entails substantial healthcare expenditures and indirect costs due to lost productiv - ity and disability. A study from the United States (US) showed that the annual medical expenditure of COPD patients was ap - proximately 2.5 times higher than that of the patients without COPD. The COPD- specific attributable cost was $25.3 billion US dollars (USD) in 2019 (or $1445 USD per patient), with pro - jections rising to $60.5 billion USD by 2029 [ 2]. Notably, these estimates do not include indirect costs such as loss of productiv - ity and disability affecting both patients and caregivers.

12,3,"575diagnosis and providing personalised, comprehensive treatment yield clinical outcome improvement [ 3]. Screening policies ei - ther based on questionnaires alone or combined with spirometry seem to be cost- effective [ 4]. This review aims to summarise key evidence- based findings from the previous year with a focus on the patho- physio- biology of COPD, investigation tools, and multimodal treat - ment options encompassing both pharmacological and non- pharmacological therapies, as well as the management of comorbidities. 2 | Non- Smoking COPD Tobacco smoking is a well- established primary cause of COPD. However, in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), it ac - counts for only 30%–40% of COPD cases [ 5]. A recent systematic review and meta- analysis from China, involving nearly 500,000 participants, found that 41.1% of COPD patients were never- smokers, with a markedly higher proportion among women (81.3%) compared to men (22.3%). The study also demonstrated a significant association between biomass fuel and COPD in never- smokers (OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.06–1.44) [ 6]. Similarly, a study from India reported a higher prevalence of non- smoking COPD among women, identifying biomass fuel exposure as a major risk factor [ 7]. Indoor and outdoor air pollution are increasingly recognised for their health complications globally. Approximately 7.3 billion people, with 80% in LMICS, are directly exposed to unsafe av - erage annual particulate matter2.5 (PM2.5) levels [ 8]. PM2.5, an ultrafine particle capable of penetrating deep into small airways and alveoli due to its size, exerts toxic effects from various chem - ical compositions and oxidative activity [ 9]. Long- term exposure to PM2.5, despite a low level, has been associated with increased all- cause mortality. A pooled analysis from large cohort studies from Canada (MAPLE), the US (Medicare), and Europe (Elapse) approximates a hazard ratio of 1.04",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,4,"for all- cause mortality per 5 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration [ 10]. Small airway function is significantly impacted by inhaled pol - lutants. Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25%–75%) has widely been used to evaluate small airway dysfunction due to its simplicity and accessibility from spirometry data, despite its lack of reproducibility and forced vital capacity (FVC) dependence. More data are emerging with respiratory oscillometry measurements. Increased air pollu - tion exposure, including PM2.5, PM10, Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), and Carbon monoxide (CO), has been related to a FEF25%–75% decrease with confirmed effects across various populations [ 11, 12 ]. Furthermore, there was a signifi - cant correlation between the annual change in air pollution con - centration and small airway disease [ 12]. Although the exact underlying mechanism is still elusive, several pathways have been studied (Figure 1) [13–15 ]. One mechanistic study in animal models demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure can activate the interleukin (IL)- 4/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)6 pathway, promoting M2 macrophage polarisation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- 12 upregulation, ultimately resulting in alveolar ep - ithelial barrier dysfunction and excessive extracellular ma - trix (ECM) degradation [ 16]. PM2.5 has been shown to induce airway remodelling through up- regulation of collagen- I and alpha- smooth muscle actin (α- SMA) expression, involving the airway smooth muscle cells senescence through autophagy- induced GATA Binding Protein 4 (GATA4)/Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/nuclear factor kappa- light- chain- enhancer of activated B (NF- κB) signalling [17]. A separate study, focusing on biomass fuels- related PM2.5, demonstrated fibroblast- to- myofibroblast transition, with the possibility of mediation by phosphoinositide 3- kinase (PI3K)/ Protein kinase B (AKT)/Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 1 (TRPC1) [ 18]. Another path - way",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,5,"identified is related to the nuclear factor NF- E2- associated factor (Nrf2) pathway, which plays a role in modulating anti- inflammatory and antioxidant stress response in the lung [ 19]. These emerging mechanistic insights highlight the distinct biological pathways underlying COPD development from var - ious non- smoking exposures, which may differ from those in smoking- related COPD, and offer promise for novel therapeu - tic strategies aimed at preventing disease progression rather than merely alleviating symptoms. 3 | Airway Inflammation and COPD Endotypes COPD is a chronic inflammatory condition with two key patho - logical sites in the respiratory system: peribronchovascular Summary • In LMICs, 30%–40% of COPD cases are unrelated to smoking, particularly among women with biomass fuel exposure and air pollution identified as key con - tributing factors. • PM2.5 exposure contributes to mortality and small airway dysfunction. • Distinct inflammatory and remodelling mechanisms in non- smoking COPD suggest opportunities for tar - geted intervention. Summary • COPD airway inflammation involves diverse immune and structural cell interactions. • ‘Eosinophilic COPD’ may represent a distinct entity from ‘eosinophilic asthma,’ with differing biology and treatment responses. • Multi- omics and machine learning are helping de - fine COPD endotypes with potential for precision treatment.",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,6,"576 Respirology, 2025fibrosis in the small airways and emphysematous changes caused by alveolar wall destruction. Clinical phenotypes of COPD patients are varied, ranging from different aetiologies (smoking versus non- smoking) and clinical presentations (breathlessness versus chronic productive cough or frequent exacerbator versus non- exacerbator). While a clinical- based approach can categorise patients into distinct groups, it has limited utility in guiding treatment aimed at halting further lung damage. Two identified genetic conditions predispos - ing to COPD development are Alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and telomere polymorphisms [ 20]. Identifying AATD and providing augmentation therapy has shown survival ben - efits [ 21]. The COPD airway inflammatory pathway not only involves neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils, but also a diverse array of cells in the immune system: CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILC) [ 22]. In addition, structural cells (airway epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts) contribute to the inflammatory process through complex cytokine pathways (Figure 1 ) [20, 23, 24 ]. Blood eosinophils have been widely used as a biomarker for COPD management as a predictor of acute exacerbation and response to inhaled corticosteroid treatment (ICS) [ 25]. The concept of ‘Eosinophilic COPD’ has garnered increasing inter - est, largely due to the success of eosinophil- targeted biologic therapies in asthma. However, recent evidence suggests that not all eosinophils are functionally equivalent. A study compar - ing eosinophil subtypes from stable asthma and COPD patients revealed a differing proportion of inflammatory eosinophils (iEos), which were more abundant in patients with asthma, re - gardless of total eosinophil count. iEos also express more IL- 5 receptors than resident eosinophils. Interestingly, iEos number in COPD patients was not associated with inhaled corticosteroid use, disease severity, or exacerbation rate [ 26]. These findings raise important",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,7,"questions about whether eosinophils function as bystander biomarkers in COPD and challenge the reliability of blood eosinophil counts as a standalone marker for guiding personalised treatment (discussed further under section 6.1 on biologics). Advances in multi- omics technologies have enhanced our understanding of COPD at the molecular level. Proteomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics profiles of eosinophils iso - lated from COPD and Asthma- COPD overlap (ACO) patients demonstrated the role of IL- 33, TNF- α, and IFN- γ in eosin - ophil activation pathways [ 27]. Transcriptomic analysis using gene expression from airway epithelial cells in COPD with airway eosinophilia (defined by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils > 1%) demonstrates increasing expression of Type 2 airway inflammation, IL- 13, and mast cell activation. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroid ICS leads to a reduction of this signature [ 28]. Furthermore, data from multi- omics analysis also confirmed the divergence of COPD pathobiol - ogy. Similar clinical phenotypes can be driven by molecu - larly distinct small airways and immune response patterns. Integrating each omics data algorithm with machine learn - ing also provided promising results to identify lung- specific COPD endotypes [ 29–31 ]. 4 | Investigations in COPD Diagnosis of COPD comprises the presence of respiratory symptoms and relevant risk factors, followed by diagnosis con - firmation with spirometry demonstrating post- bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/FVC ratio less than 0.7. However, recent guidelines recommend using the lower limit of normal of this ratio as a diagnostic cut- off for airflow limita - tion, as it physiologically declines with age [ 32]. Using a fixed ratio strategy may lead to underdiagnosis of COPD in young individuals. The term Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm) was mentioned recently, defined as an FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 with abnormal spirometry (i.e., FEV1 < 80%). Analysis of",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,8,"the US National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (2007–2012), using pre- not post- bronchodilator (BD), esti - mated PRISm prevalence at 9.6%–10.2% compared to 13.1%– 14.3% of COPD, with higher rates observed in females [ 33]. The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study further evaluated spirometry interpretation using a cut- off of pre- BD FEV1/FVC Z- score at the 10th percentile, with participants followed from age 45 to 53. This cohort study found that individuals meeting this criterion had a 36- fold increased risk of developing COPD over 8 years, with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 87% [34]. The BOLD cohort study ( n = 30,757; median follow- up of 8.4 years) demonstrated that applying a pre- bronchodilator (pre- BD) FEV1/FVC Z- score threshold at the 9th percentile facilitates the early detection of airflow obstruction, particu - larly among current smokers [ 35]. The Nagahama study from Japan reported that 53% of individuals with PRISm initially presented with respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnoea, while 39% of asymptomatic participants developed symptoms within 5 years. PRISm was identified as an independent risk factor for developing COPD regardless of smoking history or comorbidities [ 36]. Beyond its diagnostic role, spirometry also provides the mortal - ity prognosis. In the ex- smoker and current smoker populations, using an FEV1/FVC cut- off of 0.7 provided benefits in survival outcomes. The study in older adults using a remaining life ex - pectancy (LE) as a surrogate for future mortality risk revealed the lower remaining LE in the ex- smoker and non- smoker group with respiratory symptoms with FEV1/FVC < 0.7 compared to the group with FEV1/FVC ≥ 0/7 [ 37].Summary • Spirometry remains essential but may miss early or atypical disease. • Applying PRISm and FEV1/FVC Z- score criteria en - hances early identification of individuals at",RESP-30-574.pdf

12,10,"577While physiologic measurement, such as spirometry, has lim - itations and is often considered a late- detection tool, advanced imaging techniques, particularly quantitative thoracic com - puter tomography (CT) have demonstrated promising value in detecting early structural changes associated with COPD. The BEACON cohort study, which included young smokers with preserved lung function (FEV1 > 80% predicted), with a median age of 39 years and a mean smoking history of 16 pack- years, demonstrated a higher prevalence of air trapping (indicating of functional small airway disease), emphysema, and abnormali - ties of lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. These ab - normalities were associated with an accelerated FEV1 decline [38]. Integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables a reliable assessment of small airway disease from a single inspi - ratory CT scan and shows a significant association with FEV1 deterioration [ 39].Furthermore, CT imaging is an informative tool for character - ising the underlying causes of airflow limitation and defining prognosis. Not only identifying emphysema, CT can be used to assess airway pathology and mucus plugging with sev - eral quantitative parameters, including the mucus plug score (number of bronchopulmonary segments with completely oc - cluded mucus plugs) [ 40], lower total airway count (TAC), and the percentage of the wall area of the central airway (WA%) [41]. Among smokers with COPD, only one- third of smokers who had a high mucus score were noted for their mucus symp - toms [ 42]. Conversely, one- third of COPD patients who have no cough or sputum production demonstrated a mucus plug on CT. Older age, female sex, and Blac race are the risk fac - tors for silent mucus plugging [ 43]. A high mucus plug score has been associated with increased dyspnoea, a higher risk of exacerbations, oxygen desaturation, lower FEV1 (independent",RESP-30-574.pdf

Functional MRI is the imaging modality capable of assessing both structural (alveolar airspace size) and functional (venti - lation and gas exchange) changes without radiation exposure. Ventilation defect percentage (VDP) measured using hyperpo - larized 129Xe MRI is a sensitive and effective method for small airway disease evaluation [ 47]. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and mean diffusive length scale (LmD) can be used to quantify alveolar airspace dimension [ 48]. Gas exchange ef - ficiency can be evaluated through the dissolved- phase imag - ing of MRI [ 49]. These advanced imaging techniques not only offer new insights into the pathophysiology of COPD but also provide valuable tools for research and the evaluation of treat - ment outcomes. However, given their limited availability, their use in clinical practice should be targeted toward appropriately selected patients who are most likely to benefit. A summary of investigation tools for early COPD detection is provided in Table 1. Mucus plugging contributes importantly to airflow obstruc - tion in COPD and is considered one of COPD's treatable traits. Investigating airway- mucus milieu through multi- omic analy - sis holds a promise for categorising patients or novel therapeu - tic targets. A recent study of mucus properties–microbiome, using shotgun metagenomics and mucus biochemical and bio - physical analysis, demonstrated a higher concentration of mu - cins (MUC5AC and MUC5B) as well as the co- association of Achromobacter and Klebsiella in patients with accelerated lung decline [ 50].

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)—an inflammatory biomarker primarily reflecting IL- 13- mediated Type 2 inflammation and commonly used in asthma—has demonstrated greater temporal stability throughout the day in patients with stable COPD [ 52]. However, the role of FeNo as a predictive biomarker for treatment such as dupilumab, partic - ularly in current smokers, remains to be fully elucidated. Data from BOREAS [ 53] and NOTUS [ 54] trials, which investigated the efficacy of dupilumab, showed clinical benefit regardless of baseline FeNO levels, whether above or below 20 parts per billion (ppb). These findings suggest that FeNO may not serve as a standalone predictor of treatment response in eosinophilic COPD and highlight the need for further biomarker validation. 5 | The Treatable Traits Approach in COPDThe treatable traits (TT) model represents a paradigm shift from the traditional ‘one- size- fits- all’ approach toward per - sonalised, person- centred care in various respiratory dis - eases, including COPD. This new novel model of care uses a multidimensional assessment, identifying clinically relevant, measurable, and modifiable components of the disease. These traits, simply categorised into three primary domains: pulmo - nary, extrapulmonary, and behavioural/lifestyle risk factors [55] are of limited value and are just buzz words unless they are combined with appropriate biomarkers that reflect the pathobiology in individual patients. The model emphasises person- centred care and has demonstrated benefits in improv - ing quality of life, reducing hospitalisations, and enhancing treatment precision in both asthma and COPD [ 56]. Figure 2 outlines a comprehensive care model, covering key elements from fundamental inhaler therapy to novel interventions such as targeted lung denervation [ 57, 58 ]. It also integrates man - agement of extrapulmonary and behavioral factors, highlight - ing a holistic approach. Recent expansions of this approach include",RESP-30-574.pdf

This preventative strategy is supported by a gene–environment interaction framework, which emphasises early- life exposures and susceptibility.

As the model is integrated into primary care and early- stage disease management, this approach provides a targeted and adaptable strategy to address COPD heterogeneity across its entire clinical spectrum. 6 | COPD Treatment 6.1 | Biological Therapy in COPD Two biologic agents targeting the IL- 5 pathway—mepolizumab and benralizumab—failed to meet the primary endpoint of exac - erbation reduction in patients with COPD who had eosinophilia, although post hoc and pre- planned analyses showed efficacy in those with moderately raised blood eosinophil numbers. In METREX, the mepolizumab 100- mg dose did not significantly lower the annual exacerbation rate in the overall population. However, in the eosinophilic subgroup, defined by a history of eo - sinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL during the previous years or ≥ 150 cells/ μL at screening, a modest but statistically significant 18% reduc - tion was observed (rate ratio 0.82, p = 0.04). While the METREO trial, which recruited only eosinophilic patients with the same criteria but using 100- and 300- mg doses, failed to achieve sig - nificance (rate ratios 0.80, p = 0.07 and 0.86, p = 0.14, respec - tively). In the benralizumab trials, a blood eosinophil cutoff of ≥ 220 cells/μL was used [ 60]. The GALATHEA study, using the benralizumab 30- and 100- mg dose, demonstrated rate ratios of 0.96 ( p = 0.65) and 0.83 ( p = 0.05), respectively. A TERRANOVA study, using the benralizumab 10- , 30- , and 100- mg dose, yielded rate ratios of 0.85 ( p = 0.06), 1.04 ( p = 0.66), and 0.93 ( p = 0.40), respectively, with no statistically significant reduction observed [61].

In addition, a recent phase 2 study (ABRA) showed the potential role of using benralizumab (a single 100- mg dose subcutane - ously) during acute exacerbation of eosinophilic airway disease, including asthma and COPD. Eligible patients had blood eosin - ophil counts > 250 cells/μL during the stable state and > 300 cells/μL during exacerbation. Among 158 participants, 32% had a diagnosis of COPD without asthma. The study demonstrated fewer treatment failures at 90 days in the benralizumab group (with or without concomitant prednisone) compared to the prednisone- alone group (45% vs. 74%; odds ratio 0.26; p = 0.0005) [63]. Both molecules are currently under investigation in large phase- 3 clinical trials enriched for patients with blood eosino - phils > 300 cells/μL (mepolizumab: METINEE, NCT04133909, benralizumab: RESOLUTE, NCT04053634). Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets IL- 4 re- ceptor alpha, thereby inhibits both IL- 4 and IL- 13 pathways, has demonstrated efficacy in COPD with blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL in phase 3 clinical studies—BOREAS and NOTUS [53, 54 ]. Administered at the same dosage used for asthma (300 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks), dupilumab signifi - cantly reduced the annualised rate of moderate or severe exac - erbations compared to placebo, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.687. Improvements in FEV1 were observed as early as week 2, reached statistical significance by week 12, and were sustained through week 52. This rapid and sustained FEV1 improvement suggests a potential role in mucus clearance, in addition to anti- inflammatory effects. In addition to lung function improve - ment, dupilumab demonstrated symptom improvement benefits. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of severe exacerbations between the dupilumab and",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,19,"placebo groups from pooled data analysis (0.084 vs. 0.124; p = 0.073) [ 64]. The COURSE study, a phase 2a trial evaluating tezepelumab— anti- thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) mAb, used double the approved asthma dose (420 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks) in patients with moderate to severe COPD, regardless of eosino - phil count. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing moderate or severe exacerbations, a signal of efficacy was observed in the subgroup with blood eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/ μL [ 65]. These findings highlight the importance of appropri - ate patient selection for biologic therapy in COPD, rather than reflecting the inherent inefficacy of the drug. Additionally, it is worth noting that the COURSE study was conducted during the COVID- 19 pandemic, during which SARS- Cov- 2 has been shown to disrupt airway epithelial tight junctions and alter TSLP expres - sion, potentially confounding the observed therapeutic effects of tezepelumab. Overall, the role of tezepelumab in COPD remains to be further explored. A summary of clinical trials investigating biologic therapies for COPD is presented in Table 2 . 6.2 | Smoking Cessation Smoking cessation plays a crucial role in COPD management, providing mortality benefits, altering the trajectory of lung function decline, and alleviating respiratory symptoms [ 69]. Although several pharmacologic options are approved for smok - ing cessation, selecting the most appropriate therapy for each pa - tient remains challenging.

Varenicline—a α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist—demonstrated greater efficacy than bupropion in normal NMR metabolizers COPD smokers. While bupropion showed comparable efficacy in slow NMR metabo - lizers, it had fewer adverse effects [ 71]. For the patient who pre - viously failed varenicline, continued treatment with a higher dose has been shown to increase abstinence rates. Similarly, in - dividuals who did not respond to combination nicotine replace - ment therapy (NRT) may benefit from either dose escalation or switching to varenicline, both of which have been associated with improved cessation outcomes [ 72]. In addition, cytisine—a plant- derived partial agonist of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor—has demonstrated higher abstinence rates compared to usual care or NRT and comparable effectiveness to nortrip - tyline, with fewer reported adverse effects than varenicline. However, direct comparative data on the efficacy and safety profile of cytisine versus varenicline remain limited and merit further study [ 73–75 ]. E- cigarettes were proposed as an alterna - tive option for nicotine addiction therapy. One study reported a 28.9% abstinence rate from tobacco smoking in the e- cigarette group compared to 16.3% in the control group. However, when considering complete nicotine abstinence, the rate was lower in the e- cigarette group (20.1%) than in the control group (33.7%) [76]. These raise concerns about continued nicotine dependence as well as health risks of e- cigarettes, including e- cigarette or vaping product use- associated lung injury (EVALI), cytotoxicity and DNA damage to airway epithelial cells, increased airway inflammation, and decreased mucociliary clearance [ 77]. The use of e- cigarettes for smoking cessation remains controversial, as the potential risks outweigh the benefits; moreover,",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,22,"efforts to promote vaping cessation should be further strengthened. There is also evidence supporting the use of varenicline for vaping ces - sation [ 78, 79 ]. 6.3 | Mood Disorder Management COPD is well recognised to be associated with an increased risk of depression. An observational study using bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis identified depression as a po - tential causal contributor to morbidity in patients with COPD [80]. Negative mood states have also been shown to influence the perception of dyspnoea. Participants exposed to negative emotional visual stimuli reported higher dyspnoea intensity scores during exercise testing compared to neutral or positive stimuli [ 81]. Contrariwise, breathlessness symptoms can be at - tributed to unfavourable emotional experiences, including panic attacks, thereby propagating the vicious cycle between dyspnoea perception and mood disturbance.

There has also been interest in treating dyspnoea with antidepres - sants. However, the BETTER- B trial, a Phase 3 randomised controlled study evaluating mirtazapine (15–45 mg orally) for severe breathlessness, found no significant improvement in dys - pnoea compared to placebo [ 83]. 6.4 | Pulmonary Rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is well known for its benefits, including reduced dyspnoea, enhanced exercise capacity, and improved quality of life, achieved through improved oxygen utilisation, mitochondrial function in skeletal muscles, and en - hanced airway mucus clearance. Among patients with acute ex - acerbations of COPD (AECOPD), PR has been shown to reduce hospital readmissions and improve submaximal cardiovascular performance [ 84]. In ex- smokers with stable COPD, an 8- week PR program was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk [ 85]. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with endo- bronchial valves (BLVR- EBV) is an interventional treatment designed to reduce pulmonary hyperinflation in emphysematous patients and thereby improve ventilation efficiency. Both PR and BLVR- EBV have demonstrated benefits in selected patient populations. A randomised controlled trial assessing the combined effect of these modalities used constant work rate cycle test endurance time as the primary endpoint. The results showed a modest im - provement in endurance time among patients who received PR following BLVR- EBV [ 86]. This finding should not be interpreted as a diminished value of PR. Rather, the specific disease phe - notype of patients selected for BLVR- EBV may explain the at - tenuated response. These findings underscore the importance of continuing PR post- BLVR- EBV and support the recommendation to encourage PR participation in the subgroup of patients [ 87]. 6.5 | Long- Term Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,25,"Long- term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTDOT)—oxygen use for more than 15 h per day—has documented a survival benefit for patients with severe resting hypoxemia (partial pressure of ox - ygen in the arterial blood (PaO2) ≤ 55 mmHg) but not in the mild to moderate hypoxemia or nocturnal desaturation group [ 88]. A recent post hoc analysis provided intriguing data suggesting a potential survival advantage of LTDOT in patients with early desaturation during the 6- min walk test, defined as oxygen sat - uration < 88% within the first minute. Over a mean follow- up of 4.48 ± 2.97 years, survival in the LTDOT group was 76%, com - pared to 11% in the non- LTDOT group, with mean survival times of 11.83 ± 1.12 years versus 4.24 ± 0.39 years, respectively. These findings must be viewed in the context of their methodological limitations as they stem from a subgroup analysis of a study not originally designed to test this hypothesis. Prospective, well- controlled studies are needed to validate these results [ 89]. 7 | Comorbidities in COPD Although COPD is primarily a disease of airway inflammation, the inflammatory process extends beyond the lungs. Its systemic nature contributes to a shared pathogenesis with cardiovascular diseases, increasing the risk of conditions such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. This elevated cardiovascular risk has been observed across all COPD phenotypes—chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and combined phenotypes—with re - ported odds ratios of 1.76, 2.31, and 2.98, respectively, compared to individuals without COPD [ 90]. These findings underscore the importance of cardiovascular screening in COPD, which re - mains challenging due to the overlap and masking of symptoms. The particularly elevated risk in patients with the combined phenotype suggests the involvement of multiple underlying mechanisms, highlighting the need for a better understanding",RESP-30-574.pdf
12,26,"of COPD endotypes and phenotypes [ 91]. Sleep- disordered breathing is also prevalent in COPD and has been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in COPD is approximately 32% and is independently associated with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and severe AECOPD. On the other hand, nocturnal hypoxemia without OSA or isolated nocturnal hypoxemia prevalence is 27%, associated with lower FEV1 and lower resting oxygen sat - uration. If left untreated, COPD- OSA overlap syndrome is as - sociated with a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.74) and increased exacerbation frequency [ 92]. Given these risks, over - night oxygen saturation monitoring or polysomnography should be considered, particularly in high- risk groups such as those with obesity. Obesity itself is independently associated with reduced lung function. Higher BMI from early adulthood cor - relates with lower FEV1 and FVC, and in women, is also asso - ciated with a lower FEV1/FVC ratio, indicating a potential link Summary • Increased CVS risk in COPD is observed across COPD phenotypes. • OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia are prevalent and linked to mortality; screening is essential. • Obesity and physical inactivity are related to lower lung function and AECOPD. • Dysfunctional breathing is common but under recog - nized in COPD; it may worsen dyspnoea and repre - sents a treatable trait.Summary • PR benefits in both AECOPD and stable COPD. • Post- BLVR- EBV patients benefit from continued PR.

Therefore, promoting weight loss and encouraging physical activity during adulthood may represent preventive strategies to reduce the future burden of COPD [ 94]. Dysfunctional breathing, or breathing pattern disorder, is a clin - ical conundrum with notable prevalence among patients with COPD. It is characterised by abnormal breathing patterns, such as hyperventilation, periodic sighing, upper thoracic breathing, and breathing asynchrony—often coexisting within the same individual. Although frequently overlooked, dysfunctional breathing is increasingly recognised as a treatable trait that may contribute to unexplained or disproportionate breathlessness, even in the presence of confirmed respiratory disease [ 95]. Based on the Nijmegan questionnaire for dysfunctional breathing [ 96], one cohort study reported almost 50% prevalence among COPD patients attending a tertiary care teaching clinic [ 97].
